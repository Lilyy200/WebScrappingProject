Also known asLouvre, the arrondissement is situated principally on theright bankof theRiver Seine. It also includes the west end of theÎle de la Cité. The locality is one of the oldest areas in Paris, the Île de la Cité having been the heart of the city ofLutetia, conquered by theRomansin 52 BC, while some parts on the right bank (includingLes Halles) date back to the earlyMiddle Ages.
It is the least populated of the city's arrondissements and one of the smallest by area, with a land area of only 1.83 km2(0.705 sq. miles, or 451 acres). A significant part of the area is occupied by theLouvre Museumand theTuileries Gardens. The Forum des Halles is the largest shopping mall in Paris.[2]Much of the remainder of the arrondissement is dedicated to business and administration.

On 13 November 2015, the arrondissement was the site (among others) ofcoordinated Islamic shootings and bombings, particularly at theBataclantheatre, which left 130 dead. About 20 years earlier,another attackhad taken place.[3]
The land area of this arrondissement is 3.666 km2(1.415 sq mi; 906 acres).
The peak population of Paris's 11th arrondissement occurred in 1911, with 242,295 inhabitants. Today, the arrondissement remains the most densely populated in Paris, accompanied by a large volume of business activity: 149,102 inhabitants and 71,962 jobs in the last census, in 1999.
The population consists of a large number of single adults, though its eastern portions are more family-oriented. There is a strong community spirit in most areas of the eleventh, and it is interspersed with pleasant squares and parks.

12th,"The12th arrondissement of Paris(XIIearrondissement)  is one of the 20arrondissementsof the capital city ofFrance. Situated on theright bankof theRiver Seine, it is the easternmost arrondissement of Paris, as well as the largest by area. In 2019, it had a population of 139,297.
The 12th arrondissement comprises theGare de LyonandBois de Vincennes. It borders the inner suburbs ofCharenton-le-PontandSaint-MandéinVal-de-Marne.
It is in the 12th arrondissement that some of the oldest traces of human occupation of the territory now occupied by Paris were found. During the construction of Bercy Village in the 1980s, vestiges of aNeolithicvillage were discovered (dating from between 4500 and 3800 BC). Subsequent excavations turned up wooden canoes (thepirogues de Bercy), bows and arrows, pottery and bone and stone tools.[2]Some of these objects are now exhibited in theCarnavalet Museum.[3]
During the Roman era, the area that is now the 12th arrondissement was a largely uninhabited wetland fed by streams originating in the surrounding hills. The area was crossed by a Roman road that linked Paris to Chelles and Meaux to the east and to Melun to the southeast.[4]
In the 11th century, the forest that would later become thebois de Vincenneswas considered to be non-arable land. WhenHugues Capet, King of the Franks, took up residence on the Île de la Cite, he used thebois de Vincennesas his hunting ground. The bois was then reserved for the exclusive use of the kings of France. UnderPhilippe Augusteit was enclosed by a 12 km wall.[5]:6
A hunting lodge was built by Louis VII around 1150, which was upgraded to a Manor House byPhilippe Auguste, who made it a royal residence that was used over the 1150-1340 period. Legend has it thatLouis IX, Saint Louis, administered justice under an oak tree in what is now the bois de Vincennes.[6]
The long process of turning this residence into a fortified castle, the Château de Vincennes, began in about 1337, whenPhilippe VIde Valois decided to build a dungeon near the Manor House. Progressive upgrades by subsequent kings led to the construction of the fortifications, theSaint Chapelle de Vincennesand several residences within the fortified walls that were designed to cater to royal tastes and standards of living. The last king to use the Chateau extensively as a royal residence wasLouis XIV, who later abandoned it in favour of theChateau de Versailles.[7]
In 1198, Foulques de Neuilly, preacher of the 4th crusade, built a small hermitage for reformed prostitutes in the marshes of what was to become the 12th arrondissement.[6]In 1204, aCistercianabbey, Saint Anthony of the Fields, was founded outside and to the east of the walls of Paris. The Abbaye was protected by fortified walls and a moat.[5]:14. Its church was dedicated to Saint Antoine, which gave the name,Faubourg Saint Antoine(Saint Anthony's suburb), to the neighbourhood that grew up around the Abbey.
The Abbey housed nuns (moniales) and, quite quickly, became an institution dominated by noble women with direct connections to both the royal house and other major noble families. The Abbesse was referred to as theDame du Faubourg. Over several centuries, the Abbey benefited from the fact that these women were well integrated into the reigning economic and political power structures of Paris.[8]
TheFaubourgdeveloped a specialty in furniture making and, especially, in cabinet making. The development was due mainly to the protection and favours accorded by the kings of France to the Abbey and its dependents, including a dispensation from taxes for artisans working in the territory of the Abbey. Moreover, in 1471,Louis XIauthorised these artisans to work freely, without being subject to the control of theguilds.[4]:12Over the years, the artisans of theFaubourgdeveloped a solid international reputation that attracted skilled craftsmen from all over Europe.[9]:275Since many of these artisans were Protestants, many were killed in August 1572 during theSaint Bartholomew's Day massacre.[5]:14
Starting in the 17th century, the Royal Mirror Manufacture was established in theFaubourgand further consolidated its reputation. This institution this would later become the multinational enterprise, Saint Gobain.[10]
The distinctive courtyards and narrow passageways that characterise theFaubourgserved groups of craftsmen who lived and worked together in the same building. This social organisation of production gradually faded out and had disappeared entirely by the final decades of the 20th century.[9]:277With the urban redevelopment of the 1980s, the plan was to use the repurposed arches under the railway viaduc of the defunct Paris-Vincennes line to house artisans' workshops. The resultingViaduc des Artsprovides workshops for a wide array of specialised crafts. Nevertheless, most traces of the furniture-making activity in theFaubourghave disappeared, though theÉcole Boule, a famous school for furniture design founded in 1886[4]:51and located in the 12th arrondissement, continues to bear witness to this ancient artisanal tradition.[11]
The area next to the Seine that is now the 12th arrondissement was favoured by the French aristocracy as the site for their luxurious country estates. These included the ""folie Rambouillet"" which built by the Protestant financier and royal counsellor, Nicolas de Rambouillet, between 1633 and 1635. The property was further developed by Madame de la Sablière (1636–1693), who received prominent non-Catholic ambassadors there prior to their formal entry into Paris.[12]She also hosted elegant receptions and salons there and offered lodging to the poet,Jean de la Fontaine. The estate was particularly known for its gardens, which were left open for the public to visit. In 1719, the estate was sold to the bankerJohn Law, who converted the gardens into leased vegetable plots.[4]:16-17,[12]Located at about the current placement of the Gare de Lyon, the estate had been completely dismantled by 1737, as shown by a map of this area dated that year.[4]:17
Another major estate was the 17th and 18th centuryChâteau de Bercy, which straddled the village of Charenton and the eastern part of the 12th arrondissement.[12]Its gardens were developed by the famous landscape architect,André le Notre. Built on a promontory overlooking the Seine, the Chateau offered broad views over formal French gardens and the river. Starting in 1804, the rapid development of the wine trade in the vicinity of the castle brought heavy river and road traffic and initiated what was to become a progressive abandonment of the property. The château itself was destroyed in 1861.[12]
The artisans and workers of theFaubourgplayed a key role in theFrench Revolutionand the violent political turmoil of the 19th century. Residents of theFaubourgwere instrumental in the taking of the Bastille on 14 July 1789. There were only seven prisoners left in the Bastille at that point and the action cost the lives of 98 attackers as well as most of the rather small contingent of soldiers charged with defending it. Of the 954 people who received official recognition for being 'conquerors of the Bastille', most were artisans and workers from theFaubourg Saint Antoine.[4]:24
The unauthorised demolition of the Bastille began the day after the Bastille was taken when an entrepreneurial business man,Pierre-François Palloy, recruited a team to tear down the fortress.[13]Recovered construction materials were subsequently sold, along with various mementos of the infamous building (keys, paper weights, etc.).[9]:272
The neighbourhood also played a prominent role in theReign of Terrorthat followed. In the southern part of what is now the Place de la Nation, aguillotinewas erected in June 1794. Of the 2,498 people guillotined in Paris during the Revolution, 1,306 were beheaded there. Their bodies were then thrown into two mass graves in what is now the nearbyPicpus Cemetery.[11]After the Revolution, the Faubourg remained a hotbed of revolutionary activity, including during theJuly Revolution, the1848 Revolutionand theParis Commune.
From 1815 onwards, the neighbourhoods that would later become the 12th arrondissement were the focus of far-reaching urban development projects. These include construction of: theJuly Column(Colonne de Juillet) on thePlace de la Bastille(1830); the Halle Beauvau (the covered market on the Rue d'Aligre, 1843); the mainlineGare de Lyon(1847–1852) and the Paris-Vincennes rail line that terminated at theGare de la Bastille(1855). The development of the railway lines had a major impact on the 12th arrondissement; at its height, the rail network (including space for servicing it) accounted for 20% of the 12th arrondissement's land area and basically cut it in two.[4]:65
Haussmannwas also active in this sector, creating arteries that would later take the names of boulevard Diderot (1854), rue Chaligny (1856), avenue Daumesnil (1859) and rue Crozatier (1861). Between 1855 and 1866, theBois de Vincenneswas refurbished by order ofNapoleon III, who wanted it to become a ""vast park for the working populations of eastern Paris"".
LaPlace de la Nationreceived its current name on 14 July 1880. Prior to that date, it was called the place du Trône, in honour of the entry into Paris ofLouis XIVand his new wife,Marie-Thérèse of Austria. Le columns and associated taxation offices that can still be seen on the eastern portion of the place, were part of a much broader set of some 60 tax barriers surrounding Paris that were designed by the architect,Claude Ledoux. Built in 1787, tax officials were stationed there to collect revenues from people as they entered Paris with their merchandise. During the reign ofLouis-Philippe(1830–1848), the statues of two French kings were placed on the tops of the two columns: Saint Louis (Louis IX) is on the 11th arrondissement side andPhilippe Augusteon the 12th arrondissement side. The sculpture that dominates the central part of the Place,Jules Dalou'sLe Triomphe de la République, was originally a contender, but not the winner, of a competition for a sculpture to be erected on thePlace de la République. However, in 1880, responding to popular demand, the municipal council decided to order the statue for thePlace de la Nation. Due to various delays, the finished statue in bronze was not installed on the site until 1899.[10]:280
From an administrative point of view, the present-day 12th arrondissement was created by law of 16 June 1859, which rearranged Paris into the 20 arrondissements known today. The law also extended the arrondissement by absorbing parts of the villages ofBercy(including thewine warehouses of Bercy) andSaint-Mandé.[11]
The firsttown hall, located to the southeast of the current town hall, was burned down by theCommune. The current town hall was built in 1876 on Avenue Daumesnil, following the plans of architect Antoine-Julien Hénard.[11]
TheBois de Vincenneswas given to the City of Paris by EmperorNapoleon IIIin 1860, but was not officially integrated into the 12th arrondissement until 1926.[11]
The arrondissement benefited from numerousurban renewaland public works projects, many of them initiated during the 1980s. Two of the eight 'Grands Projets of Francois Mitterrand' that were the hallmark of his presidency were located in the 12th arrondissement. These were theOpéra de la Bastilleand theMinistry of the Economy and Finance building.
Major projects in the eastern section of the arrondissement include the French Ministry of Finances,Bercy Village, theParc de Bercyand theBercy arena, now renamed Accorhotels Arena.[14]Much of the land these structures now occupy was formerly district ofwine warehousesfor wine and spirits arriving by river transport from Burgundy and the Loire.[9]:284
Farther to the west, the arrondissement also features theOpéra de la Bastille, the second largestopera housein Paris. It was inaugurated byFrancois Mitterrandin 1989, on the 200th anniversary of thestorming of the Bastille.
TheCoulée verte René-Dumont(or Promenade plantée) was developed at the same time as the Opéra de la Bastille. It is a 4.7 km (2.9 mi)elevatedlinear parkbuilt on top ofobsolete railway infrastructure. TheViaduc des Arts, a string of workshops for skilled artisans, is also part of this development. It is located at the base of the western part of theCoulée verte René-Dumont.
Like most neighbourhoods in Paris, the 12th arrondissement offers a rich array of historically important and aesthetically appealing sites. For the 12th, these sites emerged mainly from development during the 19th century and from the late 20th century urban renewal projects. They include:
The land area of this arrondissement is 16.324 km2(6.303 sq mi; 4,034 acres), two-thirds of which consists of theBois de Vincennespark. Excluding the Bois de Vincennes, its land area is 6.377 km2(2.462 sq mi; 1,576 acres).
The peak of population of Paris's 12th arrondissement occurred in 1962 and was followed by three decades of decline. More recently, however, the population has begun to grow again, especially since the urban renewal projects of the 1990s. However, the 2018 census showed a slight decline in population.

The 13th arrondissement is also home to theBibliothèque nationale de France's François Mitterrand site and the newly built business district ofParis Rive Gauche.
The 13th arrondissement is still growing in population, mainly because of an influx of Asian immigrants. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the first wave of Vietnamese refugees from theVietnam Warsettled in the arrondissement, largely concentrated near Masséna Boulevard. Later waves of refugees and Asian immigrants transitioned from being exclusivelyethnic Vietnameseto includeethnic Chinese from Vietnam,LaotiansandCambodians. These migrants largely settled in the southern area of the arrondissement, creating an Asian quarter and establishing a commercial district and community institutions.[4]Teochew,Cantonese,Vietnamese,LaoandKhmerare spoken by many residents in the community.
At the last census in 1999, the population was 171,533. The 13th arrondissement is also rapidly growing in business activity, thanks to the new business district ofParis Rive Gauche. In 1999, the arrondissement contained 89,316 jobs, a number that has since grown.
