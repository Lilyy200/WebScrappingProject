The Ritz may not in fact be the fanciest hotel in Paris anymore, but it's always in the running.

Refurbished many times, the last time in 2007 by Philippe Stark, it has followed the changing demands of travellers yet retains numerous artefacts of its long history. Both its rooms and its famous ground-floor restaurant are frequent haunts of celebrities of all sorts, and it becomes a true potpourri of famous faces during the Paris Fashion Weeks.\n48.865472.3296919Renaissance Paris Vendôme Hotel,4 Rue Du Mont Thabor.Hidden in a side street and slightly demure, the Renaissance offers a welcome break from the revival-furniture-and-chandelier-filled surrounding hotels.

Not all rooms are created equal, and to get the best, one needs to shell out a significant supplement for the Tuileries view and high floor. All rooms are quite large by Parisian standards, though. The hotel has a sizeable area devoted to function rooms, and there is almost always something happening inside. When not closed for an event, the Summer Terrace is a highlight.\n48.8625382.3410621Centre International BVJ Paris-Louvre,20, rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau(Métro: Louvre),☏+33 1 53 00 90 90,fax:+33 1 53 00 90 91.This is just about as cheap as it's going to get in the 1st.
