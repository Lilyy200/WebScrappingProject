The lovely owner talked us through how they make their delicious broth, confirming that each batch is made with large bones of Charolais beef (French bred and certified) which are slowly cooked each day to ensure a balanced flavour and freshness (there is no overnight broth which is why the broth is so clear in comparison to the cloudiness of other restaurants). The sweetness and flavours of the beef infiltrates the soup, without the need for strong seasoning (which some other restaurants will use to substitute flavour).  The che dessert is made fresh (not with artificial powders) and with quality coconut milk therefore there is a limited amount available so don‚Äôt miss this before they are sold out.  It‚Äôs a shame we do not live in Paris as we would certainly be regulars. Highly recommend this restaurant for those that want to enjoy high quality and authentic pho and che.', 'Everything we ordered tastes so good and got great portions, too. Eating outside on the street isnt also loud so it‚Äôs a great place to sit outside and enjoy the summer weather of Paris though you can also sit inside. Overall, would recommend if you‚Äôre into Vietnamese food with big portions. If you are a small eater, consider sharing with someone.\n\nEnjoy!', 'Authentic Vietnamese food. Taste just like like the way I remember  in my childhood . I always order beef rice noodles soup and my husband always order beef and nem rice vermicelli.  They make really good 3 colors rich coconut milk drink/dessert.', ""Pho 18 serves a good bun bo hue, on the menu as 'soup speciale au pied de cochon', with side of shrimp paste for adjustment to your liking.

The room was nicely furnished and comfortable, though you should note that a realtor might call the rooms ‚Äúcozy.‚Äù  Not a lot of space to stash thing like your luggage, so my wife used the drawers and I lived out of my suitcase.\n\nBreakfast is available on the first floor, and their restaurant is on the ground floor.  As noted above, the hotel is pet-friendly, and they thoughtfully brought a dog bed to our room.  No extra charge for bringing a pet along, which was nice.\n\nThe area around the hotel is jam-packed with wonderful boulangeries and a range of restaurants.  We sampled several, in addition to the hotel restaurant.\n\nRoom rates were very reasonable, especially given the location near the Eiffel Tower.  I can heartily recommend the Thoumieux Hotel.', ""We recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Thoumieux in Paris, and it was nothing short of magical! From the moment we stepped into the charming boutique hotel, we were greeted with warmth and exceptional service. A special shoutout to Jennifer at the front desk, who went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect. Her friendliness and local recommendations made our trip even more memorable‚Äîshe's a gem! The decor is chic, blending modern elegance with classic Parisian flair, making the ambiance feel both luxurious and cozy.\n\nOne of the true highlights of our stay was meeting Ubu, the hotel's resident cat. Ubu adds such a delightful touch to the experience, wandering around like the true king of the hotel. His friendly and laid-back presence makes the hotel feel like home, and I found myself looking forward to our daily encounters. It's not every day you meet a cat with such personality!\n\nThe rooms were impeccably clean and stylish, with thoughtful amenities and a comfortable bed that made it hard to leave. The location is perfect for exploring the city, and the restaurant downstairs is a must-try‚Äîdelicious food with impeccable service.\n\nOverall, Hotel Thoumieux exceeded all of our expectations. If you're looking for a unique Parisian experience with a touch of feline charm, this is the place to be!"", ""The location of the hotel is great.  The rooms were clean and spacious by European standards. We were 2 floors up from the street via a narrow staircase.  No elevator. That is also not uncommon and hotel staff did offer to assist with our bags. The front part of the main floor was under construction which spilled over into the reception area. Two small areas of concern.  1) We believed we had paid a rate that included breakfast. When I went to check it out in the morning for my wife and I, staff informed my we did not have breakfast included. My wife decided to stay in the room and get ready to leave. I ordered coffee and looked at news for about 30 minutes. At that time, the staff informed me they made a mistake and we did have breakfast included. It was too late for either my wife or I to enjoy it as we had to get to the airport. 2) They have a cat(s). The house cat was cute enough but I have an allergy and he/she obviously goes into guest rooms. I had to block the cat from entering the room with us each time. If you love cats, you might enjoy this but if you don't, beware."", ""Pauline was super kind and helpful.

Its popularity is evident, with a bustling atmosphere especially around lunchtime.\n\nThe croque madame was elevated with exceptionally stretchy cheese and topped with a perfectly cooked sunny-side-up egg, the dish struck an ideal balance between richness and creaminess. A light leafy salad accompanied the croque, dressed in a punchy yet light vinaigrette that added a welcome freshness to cut through the richness of the main component.\n\nTo complement the meal, the Vitamine drink (a blend of carrot, ginger, and apple) offered a mellow and subtly sweet flavor profile with pleasant earthy undertones. This thoughtfully crafted beverage provided a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the croque madame.\n\nThe atmosphere is one of the strongest assets. The interior is tastefully designed with handsome dark woods providing a sophisticated backdrop to a light, bright space. This thoughtful contrast creates a warm and inviting ambiance. The cozy setting is further enhanced by street facing doors, which can be opened to blur the line between indoor and outdoor dining. This feature not only allows for excellent people-watching ‚Äì a quintessential Parisian pastime ‚Äì but also creates an airy feel when open. On pleasant days, it transforms the dining experience into something akin to a Parisian sidewalk caf√©. The inviting aromas wafting through the space further enhance the sensory experience, enticing both seated diners and passersby.\n\nService was a highlight, with staff being both attentive and friendly. The efficiency of service was noteworthy, especially considering the popularity during peak hours.\n\nThis bistro successfully captures the essence of French dining, from its menu offerings to its ambiance.\n\nFor those seeking an authentic French bistro experience, this establishment delivers. Whether you're in the mood for a leisurely lunch or a cozy dinner, it offers a delightful escape to Paris, if only for a meal. Just be prepared for a potentially busy atmosphere, especially during peak hours ‚Äì though the lively buzz only adds to the authentic bistro feel.""]",7e

When I confronted her about it, she criticized how I filled out the form and suggested, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you have breakfast in the restaurant so it‚Äôs easier?‚Äù‚Äîwhich is not something you say to a guest. When our breakfast finally arrived, it was incorrect, and when we called to address the issue, she blamed me for filling out the form ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù\n\nWhen my girlfriend called to inform them that our order was completely wrong, this same person started arguing in an extremely informal manner (like a teenager), insisting that it was my fault because I had filled out the form incorrectly‚Äîeven though she had asked me to redo it with her!

In response, the receptionist claimed that there were four people in front of her who could attest that she wasn‚Äôt being disrespectful, all while verbally attacking my girlfriend with her rapid speech and lack of professionalism. Where are we now? A playground argument? Shocked by such vulgarity and unprofessionalism, my girlfriend decided to hang up.

You get half a wheel of cheese between two people, and we have never managed to finish it.\n\nThe cheese wheel gets attached to a metal frame and a heater melts the cheese slowly into a plate, where you can bring it into your plate to eat with ham, pickles and potatoes.\n\nThe fondue has a bit more kick thanks to the alcohol, but you get less of it and less things to eat with it (just bread). Very good but still better for people with slightly smaller appetites. If you're going in a group you could always have it and then steal some Raclette from the others too.\n\nA word of advice: Do not go here on a warm summer's day in the evening, as you will not be able to sleep most of the night from all the cheese üòÜ. Best to go here for lunch or early-ish dinner in the winter and go for a walk."", 'Great fondue, the portion is quite big! The staff is friendly.

They will occupy most of the seats close to us, perhaps all of the sudden we got in the middle of this and they thought they will be overwhelmed. No excuses, there is no reason to treat your guests poorly or rude. We felt unwelcome, rushed, very dissatisfied. The food wasn't bad, in fact I enjoyed the main course, not as good as I would have if the personal experience would have been different.\nAt the end, we asked for the check and left, no desert no nothing, we weren't even asked.  Take my experience for what it is, it doesn't necessarily mean it will happen to you. As for me, I will definitely take my business elsewhere more! friendly.\nPeople say French are hostile towards Americans and I refuse to believe that, we have had wonderful experiences in other places always making the best of it when it comes to the language and such. All I can say is that people like this truly embodies the steriotype and that is the saddest thing.\nGood luck."", 'Super friendly service, charming atmosphere, and novel delicious food.

What was more disappointing was the lack of communication about the delay.\n\nWhen we finally entered our room, it was clear it had not been thoroughly cleaned. There were visible remnants from previous occupants, such as red lint on surfaces and noticeable finger smudges across the mirrored bathroom walls‚Äîa key feature of the room. Additionally, our room was located at the end of a hallway, next to ongoing construction and the service elevators, making it exceptionally noisy and nearly impossible to sleep.\n\nAn unpleasant moment occurred during check-in when a staff member showed us to our room. My partner, who was still recovering from norovirus, leaned against the double-sided elevator door, unaware it would open from that side. The staff member failed to warn us and even smirked when the door opened, causing her to stumble and trip. This lack of empathy was disheartening.\n\nThe saving grace of our experience was Lionel, a standout member of the weekday staff. He took every issue seriously and went above and beyond to resolve them. Within a few hours, he found us a superior room away from the construction noise and ensured we were well taken care of. His professionalism and genuine care made a significant difference.\n\nWe also noticed a stark contrast between the weekday and weekend staff. While the weekend team was professional, attentive, and eager to assist, the weekday staff appeared indifferent and unmotivated to address our concerns. This inconsistency in service detracted from the overall experience.\n\nFor a 5-star hotel, more consistent attention to detail and guest care should be expected.', 'Given the wrong room.

The environment is nice and relaxing. The service was great.', 'My wife and I had a reservation right when they opened at 7 pm. We really enjoyed passing through the market/drugstore upstairs before going downstairs to the restaurant. We really loved the ambience, with a distinct black and red decor at the counters and throughout. We waited about 5 minutes before being seated at the counter. Note to everyone: bar/counter seating is part of the experience. If you want a super formal and intimate fine dining experience, reserve a table in the private dining area way ahead, or don‚Äôt go here. The laidback style was what my wife and I actually preferred, while getting to watch the masters at work in the kitchen. Staff was great to us, made us feel very welcome, even as Americans. As expected, the sommelier at first came off a little intimidating, first offering us a glass of champagne to kick off the night. We were then given our amuse bouche, which was like a Parmesan truffle soup with melted foie grois on the inside, it was insanely decadent and delicious, accompanied with delicious bread and butter. We decided to forego the pre-fix option (which looked great) as I wanted to try dishes that stood out to me. After ordering, the sommmelier recommended a nice bottle of white to pair with our all seafood choices. I requested the lowest priced bottle of the white Burgundy (~‚Ç¨150), to which he replied they were out of. He proceeded to then recommend another white to us that would be comparable, which much to my surprise was in fact much cheaper than the bottle we requested (~‚Ç¨95) and was perfect with our food. He also warmed up to us throughout the night, and we enjoyed interacting with him, contrary to other opinions I had seen before booking. First we started with the caviar, in which they brought us out a baseball sized dish of caviar with blinis and toppings. It was by far the most caviar we had been served at a restaurant before, and pretty self explanatory: delicious and decadent and paired perfectly with our champagne. Next we had the crispy langoustines, which were incredible. Somehow fried but insanely succulent, juicy, and tender as butter, paired with done great sauces. The chef was gracious enough to give us an extra so we could each have two, since we were sharing. Next was the roasted lobster with stuffed heads. Again, probably my favorite lobster dish I‚Äôve had, we each got half of the lobster and paired with delicious shoe string fries with a delicious aioli. Last, was THE main event: the Dover sole. It was the best fish we have ever eaten hand down, with our waiter expertly dissecting and deboning it right in front of us with a fork and spoon. This was the whole reason we came, and it exceeded expectations. On top of that, it was accompanied by the iconic Robuchon potato puree (mashed potatoes), and live up to their name as best in the world. We finished with a delicious chocolate dessert and coffee. They also capped the night off by giving us a freshly baked tray of madeleines, which were warm, soft and delicious. Note to customers: you will be asked about a tip when checking out. We didn‚Äôt care, because we felt they were deserving of one, but I know this can rub some people the wrong way. Furthermore, it‚Äôs a Michelin starred establishment, so it wasn‚Äôt cheap. But we anticipated this and came to not hold back. You get what you pay for. The only critique we would have is better cutlery. The langoustines needed a knife to cut through the fried outer layer, and the knives were less sharp than a butter knife. Overall we had an amazing night and enjoyed every aspect of our dinner at the counter. I also have to say that we were impressed with the portion sizes for it being a fine dining establishment. We actually probably ordered too much food for the two of us, but everything was so delicious, we managed to finish all of our dishes.. We hope we can visit again one day to have the Dover sole again and try some of their other innovative and delicious dishes.', 'We had a delightful meal at this restaurant. We enjoyed all of the dishes and the wine. Of particular note were the fish of the day (monkfish), langoustine ravioli with foie gras and the butter was just lovely.\n\nThe downfall of the restaurant is the service, while the staff are lovely, the service is very slow and at points absent. We didn‚Äôt mind too much as we lavished a longer lunch with two bottles of lovely wine.\n\nUltimately, we had a wonderful meal.', ""I travel regularly and make it a point to enjoy some of the best cuisine I can find, both for the joy of the meal and to experience another beautiful facet of the human panoply. In every regard, L'Atelier de Robuchon excelled. It is in contention for my favorite meal of all time and I hope to return many, many times. The service was superb and, unlike what one may expect from a restaurant of this class, the staff was humble, approachable, and went above and beyond to ensure every need was anticipated and met.

Complete let down from the staff (apart from bellboy who is friendly).\n\nMy advice to management: stop being so cheap and greedy.

We did the lunch tasting menu. I\'m not into fine dining, but Epicure did make me think twice.\n\nFood - ""Exquisite"" is the word. Every dish looks like a beautiful abstract painting. Multiple layers of flavors unfold into a harmony when tasting each course. Admittedly, there were 1-2 courses that we didn\'t enjoy as much, but the others were almost heavenly.\n\nService - Out of the world. During the three hours, the staff team took the best care of us. Warm welcome upon entrance, gently serving and introducing each course, recommending wines, answering my many questions on ingredients, changing utensils between each course, cleaning and tidying up the table every other ~15mins... In short, they make you feel like you are the most important person during that 3h. Sounds cliche, but who doesn\'t want to be treated like a king/queen?\n\nIdea - Jewel in the crown. Right off the bat, I figured the tasting menu was trying to tell a story, about walking by the seaside, tasting the treasures of sea, earth, and sky. It was beautiful.\n\nIt was expensive and extravagant, we might not do it again for a while. But it was a meal that we might remember for a while.', 'To even say it was a fantastic dinner would not even begin to explain this place.  It has the best service from the time you sit down to the time they call you a taxi.  From the wine pairings to the caviar, I have never had a better dinner.

I highly recommend and hope to go back when visiting Paris again.', 'After visiting three other Michelin starred restaurants in Paris i can most certainly say that Epicure is my nr 1.

I figured that it would be a long lunch which turned out to be a four and half hour lunch. Yes, the longest lunch of our lives.

The warm reddish tones continued into the dining room where we were greeted with warmth by the staff.\n\nThe food here was exceptional with not a single course veering off in excellence. It ranged from the signature caviar with potato mousseline smoked in haddock with buckwheat crips and sour cream dressing, full of umami to the perfectly cooked langoustine in lemon and thyme, onion mango and broth flavored with coriander and citrus fruits. The candele macaroni with black truffle, artichoke and foie gras filling in parmesan cheese, and black truffle juice reminded of a similar dish at Acquerello in San Francisco in visual appearance and ingredients.\n\nOut of the entire lunch full of numerous courses, there were three highlights. The salmon from Scotland in powder of tandoori spices, fennel and cucumber with mint oil and rice vinegar was stunning. Simply, it was the best cooked salmon I‚Äôve ever had in my life so far. If salmon is this good in Scotland, I wonder what other types of seafood exists in Scotland‚Ä¶ Before this, the best salmon I had was from Alaska. The hen breast poached in a bladder was incredibly moist that it cut like butter and the green asparagus with morels that accompanied it in a wine reduction with crayfish and golden chanterelles with Xeres was incredible. I immediately had a flash back to the piece of chicken served at La Grenouille in NYC some 16 years ago which was the best I‚Äôve ever had until this dish. To continue this momentum the trolley of macarons and chocolates were incredibly flavorful. I believe she said that the macarons were made on the premise every day. We love macarons and to hear my wife say that these are the best macarons I‚Äôve had so far brought immense joy.\n\nTo mark our honeymoon, the staff spread red rose petals and an edible sugar sculpture on our table during dessert time.

Then we had to rush between main dish and dessert because they were already cleaning the tables around so the party could start\n- the food was ok, the cocktails were ok too, but the waiting time for the cocktails was long as well\n- it is a good place to dance if you are into that specific music\nThe conclusion is that they are VERY understaffed as we were sitting exactly next to the open kitchen and we could see the cooks were preparing dishes non-stop.

Here‚Äôs a comparison of the two iconic locations:\n\nAmbiance and Atmosphere:\n- **Schwartz's in Montreal:** The original Schwartz's in Montreal exudes an old-world charm. The narrow, bustling space is filled with the aroma of smoked meats and the chatter of loyal patrons. It‚Äôs a no-frills, authentic deli experience that makes you feel like you‚Äôve stepped back in time.\n- **Schwartz's in Paris:** Schwartz's in Paris, while maintaining the essential deli vibe, offers a more modern and spacious setting. The decor pays homage to its Montreal roots with vintage posters and photos, but with a chic Parisian twist. It‚Äôs comfortable and inviting, yet manages to keep the essence of a classic deli.\n\n**Food Quality:**\n- **Schwartz's in Montreal:** The smoked meat at Schwartz's in Montreal is legendary. Thick, juicy slices of perfectly seasoned beef, served on rye with mustard, are the star. The poutine, pickles, and coleslaw are must-try sides that complete the experience.\n- **Schwartz's in Paris:** The Paris location impressively replicates the flavors of Montreal. The smoked meat is just as tender and flavorful, and the portion sizes are generous. However, some purists might notice a slight difference in the seasoning, possibly due to local ingredient variations. The menu also includes some Paris-specific additions, which are delightful but not traditional.\n\n**Service:**\n- **Schwartz's in Montreal:** Service at the Montreal Schwartz's is quick and efficient, though it can sometimes feel rushed due to the high volume of customers. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly, adding to the charm.\n- **Schwartz's in Paris:** The Paris Schwartz's offers a more relaxed dining experience with attentive and courteous staff. They take the time to explain the menu and make recommendations, enhancing the overall dining experience.\n\n**Overall Experience:**\n- **Schwartz's in Montreal:** There‚Äôs nothing quite like experiencing the original Schwartz's in Montreal. It‚Äôs a culinary pilgrimage for deli lovers, offering an authentic and unforgettable taste of Montreal‚Äôs food culture.\n- **Schwartz's in Paris:** Schwartz's in Paris is a fantastic homage to its Montreal counterpart. It captures the spirit and flavors of the original while adding its own Parisian flair. It‚Äôs a great option for those craving a taste of Montreal in the heart of Paris.\n\nIn conclusion, both locations of Schwartz's have their unique appeal. Montreal offers the authentic, original experience, while Paris provides a slightly more polished and leisurely version of the beloved deli. Either way, you‚Äôre in for a treat!"", ""Everything was great. The waiter's recommendations were good. They do not use pork as meat.""]",17e

They asked if we wanted champagne when we were seated, before receiving any menus. We weren't sure if it was part of the fixed menu or not, and we really should have asked.

I would consider this reasonable for the experience, but the food was not as good as I've had at other Michelin star restaurants, hence the 4 star rating."", '#41 see my reviews of all the Paris Michelin Stars.\nHumble and Flamboyance. Endearing duo.\n\nThe interesting thing here is the result of two different characters. You have Laurent Lapaire, the flamboyant owner that spotted future multiple stars chef. You can feel his influence in the styling of restaurant for example. It‚Äôs very ¬´\xa0cosmopolitan ¬´\xa0, with modern design, beautiful tableware and even waiters that are not the typical old school √©toil√© staff. The other influence is the love for the good product and his passion for haute cuisine (basically, he goes to Michelin Stars during his spare time‚Ä¶). Interestingly enough, he s the type of character that you encounter with old school chef that owns their restaurant, very lively, opinionated, with a little light in his eyes. It‚Äôs more typical of the old school big name chef. Still, I appreciate a strong character with a passion. I‚Äôve noticed in some reviews here, that‚Äôs some may be put off by that. I understand. Still, you have to recognize that he brought some great chef to the Michelin world. I‚Äôm fine with a strong character from Brittany as long as he delivers.\nWhich brings me to the second point: the chef. I had the good fortune to speak with him after the meal. He‚Äôs just like his cuisine. Very humble, hiding his maturity, playful, just enjoying making great cuisine by making the most out of the seasonal ingredients. He‚Äôs not there for the fame, nor the money, he‚Äôs there for the beauty of it. I find it very refreshing and it does give me hope in an era geared toward the show and the visual (top chef, Instagram - on which I am ;-)).\nThe interesting result is it does work. The combination of those two different characters manages to work, and I guess it‚Äôs because they have in common the love for the good ingredients.\nThe mood/dressing code seems to be modern yet relax. I had a business friendly lunch, I saw birthday, I guess it can also work for couple.\nStill, I‚Äôll put it more in the Haute Cuisine side, even if the character of chef is not pretentious.\nIt‚Äôs a very solid one star.\nI had a great experience, and it grew on me after a couple of days (I never write the reviews just after, like the wine, you want to let it develop), resulting in a very endearing memory.\n\nUpdate 2022: After years of helping chefs reach new stars (the list is so crazy with Septime, Toutain, Alliance etc‚Ä¶), the Agape manager found a Madonna. And it does bring a change in the house to have a lady. Ok, the Madonna reference was there because the new chef, Rebecca Lookwood, was her personal chef. Her resume doesn‚Äôt stop there by far. Top chef star in Brazil, formally trained in one of the best school in Paris, she even became journalist for a while.\nOk, what‚Äôs interesting? What does it mean for you? It means that the angle and even some of the ingredients will be very different from your average one star. She brings this diversity in the plate, with yet an attention to balance it. Interestingly, she‚Äôs from an English/Brazilian marriage, and I guess she‚Äôs used to be in between cultures. I would also note that being from Amazonia she is naturally eco concerned with a touch of interest in the ingredients medicinal power.  Extremely interesting and I‚Äôm looking forward to see her grow with Laurent s help. Speaking of medicinal power, he‚Äôs a strong advocate for the ‚Äúvin nature‚Äù (organic wine), which makes this restaurant way more ‚Äúeco concerned ‚Äú and ‚Äúexotic ‚Äú than it looks (and than others that are more into communication).\n\nEven if it‚Äôs a new chef, given both track records, it‚Äôs definitely still a very solid star.', 'My wife and I had the 10 course tasting menu. What started off feeling a bit stuffy ended up being a fun experience. This is a one group/couple per table per night place. The whole tasty experience took 2.5+ hours, we enjoyed every last dish, even the ""mouth preparer"" aka palate cleanser.', 'A rather average experience, given that this establishment is a one Michelin star, in comparison to other in Paris.\n\nService was ok, it was lukewarm some staff were more affable than others.\n\nHowever I am not here for the service. This year the restaurant celebrates its tenth year. I went to lunch, lunch is usually the cheaper option in comparison to dinner service. That is  not to say i did not splurge.\n\nWhat I did like were - the lobster dish & the sweetbread.\n\nWhat I dislike were - This is an easy fix, temperature in the dinning room should be comfortable, i know it‚Äôs cold and wet outside in Paris, as a dinner I don‚Äôt want to feel like I am in the kitchen with the chef. The anniversary menu was more expensive & was suppose to be a surprise, well everything on it were on the a la carte menu..if that was the surprise then yes it worked.\n\nThere were several options ala carte,3 courses, 5 courses and the anniversary menu which is effectively 7 courses. My advice if you decide to go choose the 3 courses or 5 courses or a la carte.\n\nOverall there were some exceptional cooking, even with simple dish of beetroot collection was exceptional, however the 2 full size deserts was very unexpected and tipped the experience to feeling like you‚Äôve been overfeed and feel liked a stuffed turkey.\nAlso very surprising was the absent of a cheese course, seems like a serious misstep for a French restaurant.\n\nSo these were the reasons for the rating.']",17e

They told us we must dine outside. My father in law was too cold to stay outside, it was quite an argument because we paid for it already! The host saw us and we told him the embarrassing situation. He went to the neighboring restaurant (owned by the same owner) to seat us, to which they couldn‚Äôt. My father in law surrendered thankfully.\n\nThe manager came, he looked at us seriously, and then asked us of our culture. We shared the same culture and he could tell!\n\nRegardless they were so professional, courteous and accommodating in however they could have been.\n\nLet‚Äôs get to the food, the essential factor.\n\nFood: For appetizer we had 1 escargots, and 3 of les ≈ìufs mayonnaise.\n\nI had ≈ìufs. They were made for true love. The texture of creaminess and layers of the flavor all came together like a ballet. A ballet that could make a hater of the ballet fall in love. It had truffle, and the salad mixed in had just the right hint of balsamic vinegar to lift the flavor of the truffle which I confused for some in spicy wasabi substitute but no. It was so delicious it made start writing the review to give it 5 stars in everything already.\n\nBut that‚Äôs just the beginning.\n\nI asked Michael the manager which is his preferred entree. He said the Beef. So three of us did while one of us had the Chicken and Fries.\n\nWe understood why the restaurant had every seat filled. The beef‚Äôs tenderness was just right like the shoe on Cinderella‚Äôs foot. The sauce it was glazed in melted in your mouth like a fresh warm blanket with a tang that was truly alive.\nAnd the potatoes. Again, the texture. I wish I could explain it better but it just felt like they were given the precise time and temperature mix up to remind you that cooking truly is a science as well as it is an art. They brought bread both for the appetizer and for the entree which of course have not missed once since we have been in France. We used it to complement every centimeter of sauce left in that plate. The carrots and mushrooms couldn‚Äôt be forgotten either as it was a symphony.\n\nThe chicken was perfectly cooked, of course, fall off the bone. Glazed with a sauce that was like a peanut sauce and it really was so fancy. I tried just a bit of it, and the fries with it did not miss.\n\nYou think I‚Äôm being extra? Overdramatic? Look at the picture of the beef and potatoes. Michael had places mine on the table for me. He carefully adjusted the plate so that the text on the plate would face me correctly. So no I am not being ridiculous. Everything here was ridiculously good. The epitome of what is fine dining. The taste struck that moment to me in ratatouille where the food critic goes back to his childhood. I‚Äôm not kidding.\n\nNow the dessert. The. Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e, was like no other. The top crust, standard deliciousness, can‚Äôt change how that goes. The cr√®me, was almost curated? How did they do it? Almost like they pre toasted the milk? They literally gave the cr√®me layers to its richness. The slight chill of it reminded me I‚Äôm not in the US.\n\nMichael talked with us for quite a while through it all. This place is no joke. The oldest operating restaurant in Place du Tertre. Birth place of the word Bistro, and so much more rich history. Frequented by many popular public figures, and truly, a part of my history for my family we will not forget. Thank you Michael and thank you to your staff, your chefs really deserve their flowers.

I\'m not a plant review"" Go ahead and Google my name as you will find I live in the USA, I\'ve been to Paris a number of times (3) but have only been to this place once.  Also, my wife and I have eaten at a number of places in Paris (mostly in Montmartre) but we have not been to the same place twice in the 3 times we\'ve been to Paris (again, Montmartre mostly). . . but this ends now.  Because we will definitely go to Clarion again when we come back.  The reason why we haven\'t done the same place twice (again, especially in Montmartre) is that THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT PLACES TO EAT IN PARIS!\n(Deep Breathe Pause) But I digress . . .\nNow, let\'s start with the review with Clarion.  First, though, I don\'t get why this place got bad reviews.  I have a theory.  Let\'s start with I bet most of the 1-Star Ratings are from Americans and I really mean, ""Typical Americans"" who have never been to France before.  These are probably the same people whose first words out of their mouth is ""Do you speak English?""  SWING AND A MISS!!  The only place(s) you\'re gonna be able to start with those very ""offensive"" words and get decent service is McDonalds on the Champs Elyssess (two blocks down from Arc De Triomphe) or very expensive tourist trap restaurants near the Eiffel Tower and/or Jardin des Tulieries.  Seriously.  If you\'re gonna venture out to places that are not tourist traps, please, please, s\'il te plait! Use Google Translate to at least learn the following, ""Je se deslole"" Pronounced: Jay-duu Day-suu-lay, .  Say it with confidence, ""Je suis d√©sol√© mais mon fran√ßais est nul.""  Or Jay-duu Day-suu-lay mai mon fran-say est null . . . meaning, I\'m sorry but my French sucks.  Learn little phrases that we normally say in the USA, like ""Two Chocolate Crossaints"" or ""Deux (Dew) Crossaints (Kraw-sawunts) au (OW!) Chocolat (Choc-co-laaat). Or whatever else we say when we are just shopping.\n(2nd Deep Breath) Again, I try to digress.\n(End Scene posture) Sigh.\nNow, let\'s talk about Clarion.  This place is great.  The ambiance as with all places in Montmartre has that ""Midnight in Paris"" feel.  It\'s so chic.  It\'s so warm.  It\'s so inspirational to help you think of anything art.  The service was fine IMO.  I believe the reason why this place got a lot of bad reviews of the service was because they were probably wondering why IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET MY ORDER IN! is because in France, they don\'t rush you to anything.  You savor everything, from when your first glass of beverage to when dessert is served.  You won\'t be rushed like pretty much all the Chevy\'s, Hooter\'s, Chili\'s and Applebee\'s in the USA.  The French want you to enjoy the hard work they put in cooking their food.  And that\'s what Clarion wants you to enjoy.  From the Escargot (Yes, I gave it a chance and if you like Garlic and Olive Oil, you love this stuff) to the Ribeye.  It was Mag-Ni-Feek!""  The large glass of their French Beer is something ALL WARM BLOODED AMERICANS WILL LOVE!  Alex, our server, was awesome!  What I have learned about the French is that if you make the effort by pulling out the Google Translate page and at least type what you want to say and make the effort to try and say it (instead of just showing them the pix), they\'ll give you the respect for at least trying.  Eventually, they will give you a break by just looking at what your typing and then answer your question.  The place really deserves better ratings and I heavily recommend if you\'re in the Montmartre ""arrondosment"" of Paris, you need to go to this place.  And if you are in a rush then learn, ""Pouvez-vous s\'il vous pla√Æt pr√©cipiter ma commande car nous devons √™tre quelque part. . .""  Or savor the flavor and the art that is Paris . . .and say ""Pa-Reee!""', 'ü§Æü§¢Disgusting food, disgusting service. The manager of this place is incompetent and has no idea what he is doing.
