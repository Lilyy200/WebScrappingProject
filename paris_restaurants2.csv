From the moment I walked in, the staff made me feel welcome with their warm smiles and helpful attitude. The rooms were clean, spacious, and beautifully designed, offering a perfect balance of comfort and style.\n\nOne of the highlights was the food, which made my stay even more enjoyable. The food was excellent, with a wide variety of delicious options to choose from.\n\nLocation-wise, the hotel is perfectly situated near [mention any nearby attractions, transportation, etc.], making it easy to explore the city. Overall, I had a fantastic stay and will definitely return on my next visit!\n\nHighly recommend Hotel Regina Louvre to anyone looking for a memorable stay.', 'This is a beautiful property that takes you back in time with lovely, quiet balcony views. The location is ideal and everything was easily accessible within a walking distance. The staff are also very friendly and helpful; we traveled with our 5-year old and they were very welcoming and child-friendly. They had an old-school postcard mailing service that was a really nice touch and completed the vibe of an older establishment that knows hospitality. Would definitely return here for future visits to Paris.', 'I was extremely disappointed with my stay at Hotel Regina Paris, which was far from the advertised 5-star experience.\n\nThe room was in terrible condition. It smelled unpleasant, and there were lollies stuck to the carpet in the corners, along with visible dust everywhere. The floors were creaky, and loud piping noises kept us awake all through the night. The showers were unusable, with the water temperature constantly fluctuating between boiling and freezing. To make matters worse, the master bedroom had a bathtub with a short showerhead, not a proper shower.\n\nThe only positive aspect was the friendly and helpful front desk staff. However, that didn’t make up for the unacceptable state of the accommodations. The 1 star review is only for the staff’s service.\n\nWe checked out three nights early because this hotel did not meet even basic expectations, let alone those of a 5-star establishment. On New Year’s Eve, finding alternative accommodation was challenging, so we had no choice but to stay the first night. Even with all the issues we experienced, the manager still charged us the full rate for that night and offered no compensation. Extremely frustrating as it was a high rate, it would have been cheaper to stay in a 3 star hotel and receive the same disgusting amenities for a quarter of the price.\n\nWe ended up at the Mandarin Oriental, which truly embodies luxury and deserves its 5-star reputation. Unfortunately, our experience at Hotel Regina Paris left a lasting disappointment. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a premium experience. If you are used to proper 5 star luxury, do not stay here. The pictures advertised on their website will fool you.', 'My husband and I stayed at this lovely, elegant Parisian hotel for four days.  The service was outstanding as was the location.  The staff truly cared about making our stay the best possible.  I needed to see a doctor for a minor but troublesome issue and the concierge arranged for a doctor to visit me at the hotel.  Amazing!  I highly recommend this hotel for your trip to Paris.', ""This beautiful 1900's building is absolutely stunning. All rooms have amazing views of the Eiffel Tower, the gardens or the museum.\nThe Hotel Regina Louvre offers free wi-fi, flat screen TVs, as well as being equipped with a well stocked minibar and great 24 hour room service. Would highly recommend a stab at this hotel.""]",1er

We enjoyed beautiful two-story windows that opened onto one of two squares inside the hotel property.  Our king bed was comfy and the room had two bathrooms.  One upstairs in the sitting room, and the other downstairs in the bedroom.  The breakfast buffet was good, and included a cappuccino machine.  If you ask for 'American coffee', they will bring it.  The concierge was really helpful!"", 'Nice hotel and very well located. The swimming pool is also very nice. The design of the rooms is a bit already old and they should make some renovations. Another thing to notice there was a weird smell in the kitchen area during our stay for all the 5 days.', 'From the welcome to our departure the staff was helpful, friendly and professional. The family room was spacious and very comfortable for our family of four (with teen daughters).  The maid service was excellent - supplies always refreshed. Any request ( for an iron etc.) was done in a timely fashion. The concierge was exceptional! We would stay here again and will recommend to family and friends when they visit Paris. Great location- close to major attractions and historic sites.\n\nThank you for making our stay in Paris a memorable one.']",1er

Our bags were taken to our room before we were done checking in. When I walked in with a bottle of wine from dinner, they asked if I would like wine glasses to take to the room. When we asked the front desk to schedule a taxi for a 4am checkout, they offered to have breakfast boxes and coffee to go. The rooms are commensurate in comfort and attention to detail.

The staff were so nice and lovely to us - the only complaint we had was the rooms ran a little hot and the elevator is admittedly small. However, again, cannot emphasize how lovely the staff were in welcoming us, recommending areas and nearby things to see or do, and accommodating us to make sure our quick trip to Paris was a wonderful success! Location really can’t be beat either!', ""We visited on a family vacation near the end of August and had a great stay. The location is a central area that is close to a lot of tourist sites such as the Louvre and also subway stations. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and offered plenty of recommendations and tips during our stay. And the rooms were spacious, which I wasn't expecting for Paris. When we arrived, the main elevator was broken for the first day and thus we had to rely on the staff elevator, which wasn't too bad. In general, we were all pleasantly surprised especially after a not so pleasant stay in London at a seemingly 4-star hotel.\n\nFrankly for the price, it's pretty darn good.\n\nPros:\n- Convenient location\n- Friendly and helpful staff\n- Spacious rooms for Paris\n- Windows that actually open with little balconies. Very neat.\n\nCons:\n- Elevator is small. But, that's kind of expected for the city.\n- Breakfast isn't worth the price, especially with so many walkable places to eat near you."", 'The hospitality we experienced here was world class.

They really went above and beyond. The rest of the staff was also incredible. The location is also ideal and very close to the metro station as well as lots of places to eat and shop. Not to mention the beautiful view of the Opera! The rooms are charming, clean and comfortable. I slept so well every night after long days of walking and sightseeing.\n\nWe accidentally left a couple of valuable items in our room after checking out and we were stressed out trying to find them. Renaud reached out to us after finding them and has been so helpful. We are truly so appreciative.\n\nI can’t recommend this place enough.

The room’s view was breathtaking, and the ambiance made our stay unforgettable. The staff at the bar downstairs were incredibly nice and offered timely assistance.\n\nThe hotel’s location is unbeatable—right next to Chanel’s flagship store and Saint-Honoré, making shopping extremely convenient.

While the room was spacious by Parisian standards, the tiny toilet, uncomfortable shower, and very narrow corridors made our stay less comfortable. Additionally, the breakfast area was quite small, and the staff did not seem particularly welcoming.\n\nThe decoration was distinctly Parisian, which added a charming touch, but the busyness of the room’s design might feel overwhelming for those seeking to relax after a hectic day.

I keep thinking about how wonderful it was. From the moment my fiancée and I walked in, we were treated so kindly and noticed how beautiful the place is. The receptionist that we saw for most of our stay made sure that we had a great time and knew everything that we needed to know. She also allowed us to keep our bags there until check in time since our flight was so early. The rooms are incredibly comfortable and the aesthetic of them is great. There are drinks, breakfast, and it is in a great location. I can’t think of a way that I would make my experience better.

Around the clock reception which is helpful and makes you feel safe and accommodated. The staff are incredibly sweet, feels like staying with family.', 'Great Location, But Disappointing Service\n\nI recently stayed at this hotel and booked my room the same day, which was a great deal for the area. The location is fantastic, right in the middle of St. Germain de Pres and the 6th arrondissement, which is my favorite part of Paris. Opening the window to a quintessential Parisian view was delightful, with the added charm of hearing French songs from the street below in the afternoons—like something out of a movie.\n\nHowever, the experience was marred by poor service at the front desk. While most of the staff were polite and professional, the woman at the front desk during our stay was incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. Upon arrival, she explained things in a very impolite manner, repeatedly insisting on knowing our entire schedule, including when we planned to wake up, have breakfast, and leave the room. Despite our reassurances that we would follow the hotel’s timing, she continued to insist on its importance.\n\nOur room was another issue—we received two shampoos but no shower gel. When my girlfriend asked for one, the receptionist initially refused to believe us, questioning our word and insisting that the staff never make such mistakes. Eventually, she sent someone to check, and we were proven right, but the interaction left a bad taste.\n\nThe following morning, I chose to fill out the breakfast order form and bring it directly to the front desk. The same receptionist looked at the form with clear disgust and even showed it to the cleaning lady, laughing together. When I confronted her about it, she criticized how I filled out the form and suggested, “Why don’t you have breakfast in the restaurant so it’s easier?”—which is not something you say to a guest. When our breakfast finally arrived, it was incorrect, and when we called to address the issue, she blamed me for filling out the form “wrong.”\n\nWhen my girlfriend called to inform them that our order was completely wrong, this same person started arguing in an extremely informal manner (like a teenager), insisting that it was my fault because I had filled out the form incorrectly—even though she had asked me to redo it with her! My girlfriend pointed out that regardless, this is not the way to speak to customers, and that the essence of her job is not to argue or pass judgment, let alone blame the guests. In response, the receptionist claimed that there were four people in front of her who could attest that she wasn’t being disrespectful, all while verbally attacking my girlfriend with her rapid speech and lack of professionalism. Where are we now? A playground argument? Shocked by such vulgarity and unprofessionalism, my girlfriend decided to hang up. It was truly a shocking and unpleasant experience for her to feel so attacked in this situation.\n\nThis level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable, especially at a hotel of this caliber. Hotel staff should be courteous and focused on finding solutions in a polite manner. Unfortunately, this was not our experience here.']",1er

Walking into the hotel, it’s beautifully adorned and sets the tone for a good stay, for a 4 star hotel. However upon check in is where the problems started. We booked on booking dot com and paid in advance, however the staff (front office manager) asked for my credit card for payment. I told her we’d already paid in full upfront and she snarly said “I don’t think so”…. I told her to double check and she said oh yeah… no apology for the remark. Strange how the front office manager could make such error.. had I not checked, I would have been charged again.\nWe made our way up to the room… an hour later I had a call saying that my AMEX card was in the lobby as the staff didn’t return it to me. They didn’t bring it to the room or apologise, so I made my way down to collect it.\nThe entire aura and lack of manners from the staff is disappointing. Not one smile, not an apology.\nThe next day, the shower gel was not replenished, despite us using it all. The amenities are not up to standard for a 4 star hotel at a price of over 200€ per night. After the second night, still no replies of shower gel so I complained to the front office. Again, no apology, the staff just scrabbled to find a spare small bottle of shower gel in the drawer at front office. Besides this, there are no cotton buds or any other basic amenities you’d expect, no kettle, no tea or coffee, no water.  I have had better amenities in 2 star hotels. This hotel is 2 star parading as 4 star just because they have a restaurant onsite and a concierge service.\n\nUpon checkout we were asked how many rooms, and how many adults in the room.. strange questions. No thank you for the stay or any form of sincerity.\n\nLocation is fantastic and the lobby and restaurant are beautiful. Complete let down from the staff (apart from bellboy who is friendly).\n\nMy advice to management: stop being so cheap and greedy. Provide proper amenities that reflect the level and cost of the hotel. Train your staff or hire people that actually want to be in hospitality.\nAlso, bed sheets and carpet have stains and holes. Not acceptable.', 'Good place , but I hated that the toilet is separate from the shower and sink! Imagine using the toilet then need to open tow doors to wash your hands.. there is no slippers, rope, tooth brush, water, or coffee corner.. if you need boiling water you need to go to the lobby to have one otherwise they will charge you for room service if they bring it to you.. the last thing about the open buffet I didn’t like it at all ( eggs, yogurt, cereal, mini croissants, sausages, and a small plate with 3 type of cheese only!! ) and it was pricey']",1er

They call themselves 5 stars? More like 0 stars. Here’s why:\n1- Health Hazard: I’m pregnant and planned to stay six nights. Within hours, I had a severe allergic reaction—turns out the bedsheets were dirty. You’d think a hotel charging €1,000 per night could afford clean laundry. Apparently not.\n\n2- Ridiculous Management: While I stood outside feeling miserable from the allergic reaction, instead of offering help or sympathy, they had the nerve to sell me another room for an extra €600 per night. Oh, sure, because €1,000 per night wasn’t already enough, right? Maybe the €600 room came with fresh bedsheets this time? Or perhaps the staff personally fluff your pillow while insulting you in the process? We’ll never know, because no sane person would fall for that scam.\n\n3- The Arrogant “Superstar” Staff: The young woman at the front desk must think she’s auditioning for a reality TV show because she acted like an arrogant diva instead of someone working in hospitality. Her attitude was as luxurious as a cheap motel off the highway. If she’s the face of their 5-star service, this hotel is in serious trouble.\n\n4- Basic Failures: It took FIVE HOURS to get our luggage to the room. Maybe they were busy brainstorming new ways to scam guests out of €600? And don’t even get me started on their nightclub-like entrance. It screams, “We’re trying way too hard to be trendy,” but ends up just feeling cheap and tacky.\n\n5- Lost and Found Comedy Show: We forgot a hat in the room. They found it but didn’t bother to let us know. I had to go back TWICE to beg for it. Eventually, someone at the desk made a dramatic phone call, and voilà—the hat magically appeared. Maybe they thought we’d pay €600 to get it back too?\n\nThis hotel is a joke.

While they were doing it their behavior was extremely unfriendly, unprofessional and arrogant. After our pleasant dinner, when we went to exit the place, we were once again faced with the rude receptionists and waited for them to notice us and give us our coats, which almost caused us miss our uber. The fact that the place was almost empty means their behavior intentional, and when we said our taxi was leaving and we were in a hurry, the response of the receptionist was “and what can I do about that”. They were chatting the whole time instead of actually doing their work.

Food as okay but nothing special. Wouldn’t recommend, simply a waste of time. I’d recommend trying out other nearby restaurants since the taste is in them is better. Hygiene was also an issue as our forks and plates weren’t properly cleaned.  The place is small for its demand, they can easily expand since they have more than enough customers for what they deserve.

Firstly, the dining room was quite cold, and there was an uncomfortable draft around our feet, which made it hard to fully relax and enjoy the evening.\n\nSecondly, there is no drinks menu available, which means you have no way of knowing the prices for beverages beforehand. We ordered tea, which was served in a teapot for two cups, but by the time it was poured, it was almost cold—likely due to how long it steeped before being served. When we asked for a fresh pot, the same issue occurred, and the tea was brought back lukewarm. To make matters worse, we were charged €36 for just four cups of tea (€9 per cup). If you’re going to charge that much for tea, it should at least be served hot.

Walking into the hotel, it’s beautifully adorned and sets the tone for a good stay, for a 4 star hotel. However upon check in is where the problems started. We booked on booking dot com and paid in advance, however the staff (front office manager) asked for my credit card for payment. I told her we’d already paid in full upfront and she snarly said “I don’t think so”…. I told her to double check and she said oh yeah… no apology for the remark.

Again, no apology, the staff just scrabbled to find a spare small bottle of shower gel in the drawer at front office. Besides this, there are no cotton buds or any other basic amenities you’d expect, no kettle, no tea or coffee, no water.  I have had better amenities in 2 star hotels.

Complete let down from the staff (apart from bellboy who is friendly).\n\nMy advice to management: stop being so cheap and greedy.

I didn’t have any issues with the hotel but it’s definitely not a 4 star hotel. It’s a small, boutique hotel that I would classify as 3 stars. First, there isn’t even a lobby with a reception area. There’s a communal dining table with a staff member and a laptop who checks you in. I completely didn’t even realize they were staff because they blended in with the other patrons who were using the dining table. I had room 31 which is fine for a solo traveler, but definitely not for a couple. It’s small and inconveniently designed. There’s no door from the sleeping area to the shower and sink. The toilet is a separate, closed off area, away from the sink which I would find awkward if I was sharing with a partner or a friend.The lobby also hosts a club and many DJ’s so it tends to get quite loud and packed at night. There are also plenty of clubs on the same street that I could hear at night when I’m trying to sleep.

The location is fantastic, right in the middle of St. Germain de Pres and the 6th arrondissement, which is my favorite part of Paris. Opening the window to a quintessential Parisian view was delightful, with the added charm of hearing French songs from the street below in the afternoons—like something out of a movie.\n\nHowever, the experience was marred by poor service at the front desk. While most of the staff were polite and professional, the woman at the front desk during our stay was incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. Upon arrival, she explained things in a very impolite manner, repeatedly insisting on knowing our entire schedule, including when we planned to wake up, have breakfast, and leave the room. Despite our reassurances that we would follow the hotel’s timing, she continued to insist on its importance.\n\nOur room was another issue—we received two shampoos but no shower gel. When my girlfriend asked for one, the receptionist initially refused to believe us, questioning our word and insisting that the staff never make such mistakes. Eventually, she sent someone to check, and we were proven right, but the interaction left a bad taste.\n\nThe following morning, I chose to fill out the breakfast order form and bring it directly to the front desk. The same receptionist looked at the form with clear disgust and even showed it to the cleaning lady, laughing together. When I confronted her about it, she criticized how I filled out the form and suggested, “Why don’t you have breakfast in the restaurant so it’s easier?”—which is not something you say to a guest. When our breakfast finally arrived, it was incorrect, and when we called to address the issue, she blamed me for filling out the form “wrong.”\n\nWhen my girlfriend called to inform them that our order was completely wrong, this same person started arguing in an extremely informal manner (like a teenager), insisting that it was my fault because I had filled out the form incorrectly—even though she had asked me to redo it with her! My girlfriend pointed out that regardless, this is not the way to speak to customers, and that the essence of her job is not to argue or pass judgment, let alone blame the guests. In response, the receptionist claimed that there were four people in front of her who could attest that she wasn’t being disrespectful, all while verbally attacking my girlfriend with her rapid speech and lack of professionalism. Where are we now? A playground argument? Shocked by such vulgarity and unprofessionalism, my girlfriend decided to hang up. It was truly a shocking and unpleasant experience for her to feel so attacked in this situation.\n\nThis level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable, especially at a hotel of this caliber.

Apparently not.\n\n2- Ridiculous Management: While I stood outside feeling miserable from the allergic reaction, instead of offering help or sympathy, they had the nerve to sell me another room for an extra €600 per night. Oh, sure, because €1,000 per night wasn’t already enough, right? Maybe the €600 room came with fresh bedsheets this time? Or perhaps the staff personally fluff your pillow while insulting you in the process?

If she’s the face of their 5-star service, this hotel is in serious trouble.\n\n4- Basic Failures: It took FIVE HOURS to get our luggage to the room.

It’s a timeless experience at the crossroads of a Parisian alley. The press has discussed about La Fontaine Gaillon, and its chef extensively.

That was especially disappointing given that unbeknown to most foreign visitors, a 18% minimum gratuity is already included in all restaurant bills. I saw that as a deceptive way to squeeze out more gratuity from unsuspecting tourists. It just left me with a feeling that this is a low-class place.', ""A very nice restaurant but expensive and a bit pretentious. The food was good, not overly expensive,  but all of the wine prices were out of reach for most people. They will have a limited clientele which may be just what they prefer.

Firstly, the dining room was quite cold, and there was an uncomfortable draft around our feet, which made it hard to fully relax and enjoy the evening.\n\nSecondly, there is no drinks menu available, which means you have no way of knowing the prices for beverages beforehand. We ordered tea, which was served in a teapot for two cups, but by the time it was poured, it was almost cold—likely due to how long it steeped before being served. When we asked for a fresh pot, the same issue occurred, and the tea was brought back lukewarm. To make matters worse, we were charged €36 for just four cups of tea (€9 per cup). If you’re going to charge that much for tea, it should at least be served hot.

Then we had to rush between main dish and dessert because they were already cleaning the tables around so the party could start\n- the food was ok, the cocktails were ok too, but the waiting time for the cocktails was long as well\n- it is a good place to dance if you are into that specific music\nThe conclusion is that they are VERY understaffed as we were sitting exactly next to the open kitchen and we could see the cooks were preparing dishes non-stop.

The mushroom pate was one of my favorites. I really enjoyed the texture and savoriness of this particular dish!  We also enjoyed the vegan roast with peppercorn sauce. That sauce was amazing and the stuffing was tasty. However, the vegan stew consisted of a seitan that became too moist by the time it was served to us. That said, the sauce and stew itself was perfectly seasoned. We used our leftover bread to sop up some of the stew.

The same receptionist looked at the form with clear disgust and even showed it to the cleaning lady, laughing together. When I confronted her about it, she criticized how I filled out the form and suggested, “Why don’t you have breakfast in the restaurant so it’s easier?”—which is not something you say to a guest. When our breakfast finally arrived, it was incorrect, and when we called to address the issue, she blamed me for filling out the form “wrong.”\n\nWhen my girlfriend called to inform them that our order was completely wrong, this same person started arguing in an extremely informal manner (like a teenager), insisting that it was my fault because I had filled out the form incorrectly—even though she had asked me to redo it with her! My girlfriend pointed out that regardless, this is not the way to speak to customers, and that the essence of her job is not to argue or pass judgment, let alone blame the guests. In response, the receptionist claimed that there were four people in front of her who could attest that she wasn’t being disrespectful, all while verbally attacking my girlfriend with her rapid speech and lack of professionalism.

There is absolutely no soundproofing — you can hear every movement and every conversation of the neighbors. It feels like you are living in the same space with strangers.\n\nRoom cleaning is done twice a day, but they have no regard for your schedule.

The location was perfect, close to all the attractions but still peaceful and quiet. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and luxurious stay!', ""The hotel is in a great location, steps from the Louvre and Palais Royal. The rooms are good, and the staff and very friendly. I have only a few suggestions for improvement. The hotel air on the room floors is very fragrant. I suggest reducing the fragrance. Also, I ordered room service from the Cafe 52 in the hotel using the app, but it never arrived. I suggest checking the app for functionality. I wasn't charged, but a good hotel would have offered some form of compensation after informing them at check-out, not just the chocolate bar they gave me. Also, the cleaning staff left a vacuum outside my door on the third floor and a laundry cart around the corner. A minor detail, but these items should be tucked away.

Then we had to rush between main dish and dessert because they were already cleaning the tables around so the party could start\n- the food was ok, the cocktails were ok too, but the waiting time for the cocktails was long as well\n- it is a good place to dance if you are into that specific music\nThe conclusion is that they are VERY understaffed as we were sitting exactly next to the open kitchen and we could see the cooks were preparing dishes non-stop.

The location is fantastic, right in the middle of St. Germain de Pres and the 6th arrondissement, which is my favorite part of Paris. Opening the window to a quintessential Parisian view was delightful, with the added charm of hearing French songs from the street below in the afternoons—like something out of a movie.\n\nHowever, the experience was marred by poor service at the front desk. While most of the staff were polite and professional, the woman at the front desk during our stay was incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. Upon arrival, she explained things in a very impolite manner, repeatedly insisting on knowing our entire schedule, including when we planned to wake up, have breakfast, and leave the room. Despite our reassurances that we would follow the hotel’s timing, she continued to insist on its importance.\n\nOur room was another issue—we received two shampoos but no shower gel. When my girlfriend asked for one, the receptionist initially refused to believe us, questioning our word and insisting that the staff never make such mistakes. Eventually, she sent someone to check, and we were proven right, but the interaction left a bad taste.\n\nThe following morning, I chose to fill out the breakfast order form and bring it directly to the front desk. The same receptionist looked at the form with clear disgust and even showed it to the cleaning lady, laughing together. When I confronted her about it, she criticized how I filled out the form and suggested, “Why don’t you have breakfast in the restaurant so it’s easier?”—which is not something you say to a guest. When our breakfast finally arrived, it was incorrect, and when we called to address the issue, she blamed me for filling out the form “wrong.”\n\nWhen my girlfriend called to inform them that our order was completely wrong, this same person started arguing in an extremely informal manner (like a teenager), insisting that it was my fault because I had filled out the form incorrectly—even though she had asked me to redo it with her! My girlfriend pointed out that regardless, this is not the way to speak to customers, and that the essence of her job is not to argue or pass judgment, let alone blame the guests. In response, the receptionist claimed that there were four people in front of her who could attest that she wasn’t being disrespectful, all while verbally attacking my girlfriend with her rapid speech and lack of professionalism. Where are we now? A playground argument? Shocked by such vulgarity and unprofessionalism, my girlfriend decided to hang up. It was truly a shocking and unpleasant experience for her to feel so attacked in this situation.\n\nThis level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable, especially at a hotel of this caliber.

For a restaurant with such a reputation and fine dining aspirations, our experience was far from acceptable.\n\nFirst, we were seated in a very small nook, side by side, rather than facing each other. The table was so cramped that we couldn’t even get out without the waitress physically lifting the table to let us through, which disturbed guests at neighboring tables. This arrangement was uncomfortable and completely inappropriate for a fine dining establishment.\n\nThe main course we ordered was the duck (€55 on the menu, ""for sharing 2 persons""). When the bill came, we were shocked to find that we had been charged €110—double the listed price. This lack of clarity in the menu felt misleading, and for a restaurant of this caliber, it’s simply unacceptable.\n\nAs for the food, it was just average, certainly not worth the exorbitant price we paid. With all these issues combined, we cannot recommend Allard and will certainly never return.

And when we were starting to prepare for the next course, she would take plates off the table even though we weren’t done! I had to tell her to put back our foie gras because there was still a tiny bit left that I didn’t want to go to waste! Disappointed because this restaurant came highly recommended and the food was good.

When I confronted her about it, she criticized how I filled out the form and suggested, “Why don’t you have breakfast in the restaurant so it’s easier?”—which is not something you say to a guest. When our breakfast finally arrived, it was incorrect, and when we called to address the issue, she blamed me for filling out the form “wrong.”\n\nWhen my girlfriend called to inform them that our order was completely wrong, this same person started arguing in an extremely informal manner (like a teenager), insisting that it was my fault because I had filled out the form incorrectly—even though she had asked me to redo it with her! My girlfriend pointed out that regardless, this is not the way to speak to customers, and that the essence of her job is not to argue or pass judgment, let alone blame the guests. In response, the receptionist claimed that there were four people in front of her who could attest that she wasn’t being disrespectful, all while verbally attacking my girlfriend with her rapid speech and lack of professionalism. Where are we now? A playground argument? Shocked by such vulgarity and unprofessionalism, my girlfriend decided to hang up.

Food as okay but nothing special. Wouldn’t recommend, simply a waste of time. I’d recommend trying out other nearby restaurants since the taste is in them is better. Hygiene was also an issue as our forks and plates weren’t properly cleaned.  The place is small for its demand, they can easily expand since they have more than enough customers for what they deserve. Also the pricing is average for what you get but little more expensive compared to other restaurants.', 'We went back to the restaurant after we had failed to dine in a night before.\n\nArrived 1 hour before the restaurant opens for dinner and we were the first in the queue.\n\nNot as good as what the internet has shown and a bit overhyped for me.

They call themselves 5 stars? More like 0 stars. Here’s why:\n1- Health Hazard: I’m pregnant and planned to stay six nights. Within hours, I had a severe allergic reaction—turns out the bedsheets were dirty. You’d think a hotel charging €1,000 per night could afford clean laundry. Apparently not.\n\n2- Ridiculous Management: While I stood outside feeling miserable from the allergic reaction, instead of offering help or sympathy, they had the nerve to sell me another room for an extra €600 per night. Oh, sure, because €1,000 per night wasn’t already enough, right? Maybe the €600 room came with fresh bedsheets this time? Or perhaps the staff personally fluff your pillow while insulting you in the process? We’ll never know, because no sane person would fall for that scam.\n\n3- The Arrogant “Superstar” Staff: The young woman at the front desk must think she’s auditioning for a reality TV show because she acted like an arrogant diva instead of someone working in hospitality. Her attitude was as luxurious as a cheap motel off the highway. If she’s the face of their 5-star service, this hotel is in serious trouble.\n\n4- Basic Failures: It took FIVE HOURS to get our luggage to the room. Maybe they were busy brainstorming new ways to scam guests out of €600? And don’t even get me started on their nightclub-like entrance. It screams, “We’re trying way too hard to be trendy,” but ends up just feeling cheap and tacky.\n\n5- Lost and Found Comedy Show: We forgot a hat in the room. They found it but didn’t bother to let us know. I had to go back TWICE to beg for it. Eventually, someone at the desk made a dramatic phone call, and voilà—the hat magically appeared. Maybe they thought we’d pay €600 to get it back too?\n\nThis hotel is a joke.

While they were doing it their behavior was extremely unfriendly, unprofessional and arrogant. After our pleasant dinner, when we went to exit the place, we were once again faced with the rude receptionists and waited for them to notice us and give us our coats, which almost caused us miss our uber. The fact that the place was almost empty means their behavior intentional, and when we said our taxi was leaving and we were in a hurry, the response of the receptionist was “and what can I do about that”.

I am now convinced that, in the right hands, a vegetarian approach can be as nutritious as a more traditional protein centric diet.']",6e

The way they talk wasn’t polite either. Our experience for breakfast was very good and the stuff were outstanding. The room was a disappointment. In my personal opinion it was not worth the money. The sheets were dirty in check-in and bathroom wasn’t very clean either. We came on winter and the room was freezing as the windows don’t have double glazing. You could feel the breeze around. Also behind the tv they had a pocket inside the wall to allocate all the cables. Somethings must have happened to the cover for it. They only put some tape over it instead.

Walking into the hotel, it’s beautifully adorned and sets the tone for a good stay, for a 4 star hotel. However upon check in is where the problems started. We booked on booking dot com and paid in advance, however the staff (front office manager) asked for my credit card for payment. I told her we’d already paid in full upfront and she snarly said “I don’t think so”…. I told her to double check and she said oh yeah… no apology for the remark. Strange how the front office manager could make such error.. had I not checked, I would have been charged again.\nWe made our way up to the room… an hour later I had a call saying that my AMEX card was in the lobby as the staff didn’t return it to me. They didn’t bring it to the room or apologise, so I made my way down to collect it.\nThe entire aura and lack of manners from the staff is disappointing. Not one smile, not an apology.\nThe next day, the shower gel was not replenished, despite us using it all. The amenities are not up to standard for a 4 star hotel at a price of over 200€ per night. After the second night, still no replies of shower gel so I complained to the front office. Again, no apology, the staff just scrabbled to find a spare small bottle of shower gel in the drawer at front office. Besides this, there are no cotton buds or any other basic amenities you’d expect, no kettle, no tea or coffee, no water.  I have had better amenities in 2 star hotels. This hotel is 2 star parading as 4 star just because they have a restaurant onsite and a concierge service.\n\nUpon checkout we were asked how many rooms, and how many adults in the room.. strange questions. No thank you for the stay or any form of sincerity.\n\nLocation is fantastic and the lobby and restaurant are beautiful. Complete let down from the staff (apart from bellboy who is friendly).\n\nMy advice to management: stop being so cheap and greedy. Provide proper amenities that reflect the level and cost of the hotel. Train your staff or hire people that actually want to be in hospitality.\nAlso, bed sheets and carpet have stains and holes.

The location is fantastic, right in the middle of St. Germain de Pres and the 6th arrondissement, which is my favorite part of Paris. Opening the window to a quintessential Parisian view was delightful, with the added charm of hearing French songs from the street below in the afternoons—like something out of a movie.\n\nHowever, the experience was marred by poor service at the front desk. While most of the staff were polite and professional, the woman at the front desk during our stay was incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. Upon arrival, she explained things in a very impolite manner, repeatedly insisting on knowing our entire schedule, including when we planned to wake up, have breakfast, and leave the room. Despite our reassurances that we would follow the hotel’s timing, she continued to insist on its importance.\n\nOur room was another issue—we received two shampoos but no shower gel. When my girlfriend asked for one, the receptionist initially refused to believe us, questioning our word and insisting that the staff never make such mistakes. Eventually, she sent someone to check, and we were proven right, but the interaction left a bad taste.\n\nThe following morning, I chose to fill out the breakfast order form and bring it directly to the front desk. The same receptionist looked at the form with clear disgust and even showed it to the cleaning lady, laughing together. When I confronted her about it, she criticized how I filled out the form and suggested, “Why don’t you have breakfast in the restaurant so it’s easier?”—which is not something you say to a guest. When our breakfast finally arrived, it was incorrect, and when we called to address the issue, she blamed me for filling out the form “wrong.”\n\nWhen my girlfriend called to inform them that our order was completely wrong, this same person started arguing in an extremely informal manner (like a teenager), insisting that it was my fault because I had filled out the form incorrectly—even though she had asked me to redo it with her! My girlfriend pointed out that regardless, this is not the way to speak to customers, and that the essence of her job is not to argue or pass judgment, let alone blame the guests. In response, the receptionist claimed that there were four people in front of her who could attest that she wasn’t being disrespectful, all while verbally attacking my girlfriend with her rapid speech and lack of professionalism. Where are we now? A playground argument? Shocked by such vulgarity and unprofessionalism, my girlfriend decided to hang up. It was truly a shocking and unpleasant experience for her to feel so attacked in this situation.\n\nThis level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable, especially at a hotel of this caliber.

Or perhaps the staff personally fluff your pillow while insulting you in the process? We’ll never know, because no sane person would fall for that scam.\n\n3- The Arrogant “Superstar” Staff: The young woman at the front desk must think she’s auditioning for a reality TV show because she acted like an arrogant diva instead of someone working in hospitality. Her attitude was as luxurious as a cheap motel off the highway. If she’s the face of their 5-star service, this hotel is in serious trouble.\n\n4- Basic Failures: It took FIVE HOURS to get our luggage to the room. Maybe they were busy brainstorming new ways to scam guests out of €600? And don’t even get me started on their nightclub-like entrance. It screams, “We’re trying way too hard to be trendy,” but ends up just feeling cheap and tacky.\n\n5- Lost and Found Comedy Show: We forgot a hat in the room.

Maybe they thought we’d pay €600 to get it back too?\n\nThis hotel is a joke.

While they were doing it their behavior was extremely unfriendly, unprofessional and arrogant. After our pleasant dinner, when we went to exit the place, we were once again faced with the rude receptionists and waited for them to notice us and give us our coats, which almost caused us miss our uber. The fact that the place was almost empty means their behavior intentional, and when we said our taxi was leaving and we were in a hurry, the response of the receptionist was “and what can I do about that”.

The staff was warm, attentive, and knowledgeable, which added to the overall experience.

This long delay significantly affected the flow of the evening and left us feeling a bit restless by the end. We understand that fine dining often takes time, but the extended wait toward the latter half of the meal felt excessive.\n\nOverall, the food and service were exceptional, but the timing issues did detract from the otherwise incredible experience.

Each dish is so sophisticated combining textures and flavours you would never have produced yourself; the freshness of the ingredients comes through in every dish. The bread is freshly made in the restaurant; it looks countrified but it is actually soft on the inside and flavourful. I ordered the lunch set and it was filling without being excessive.

It smelled unpleasant, and there were lollies stuck to the carpet in the corners, along with visible dust everywhere. The floors were creaky, and loud piping noises kept us awake all through the night. The showers were unusable, with the water temperature constantly fluctuating between boiling and freezing. To make matters worse, the master bedroom had a bathtub with a short showerhead, not a proper shower.\n\nThe only positive aspect was the friendly and helpful front desk staff. However, that didn’t make up for the unacceptable state of the accommodations. The 1 star review is only for the staff’s service.\n\nWe checked out three nights early because this hotel did not meet even basic expectations, let alone those of a 5-star establishment. On New Year’s Eve, finding alternative accommodation was challenging, so we had no choice but to stay the first night.

What was more disappointing was the lack of communication about the delay.\n\nWhen we finally entered our room, it was clear it had not been thoroughly cleaned. There were visible remnants from previous occupants, such as red lint on surfaces and noticeable finger smudges across the mirrored bathroom walls—a key feature of the room. Additionally, our room was located at the end of a hallway, next to ongoing construction and the service elevators, making it exceptionally noisy and nearly impossible to sleep.\n\nAn unpleasant moment occurred during check-in when a staff member showed us to our room.

This lack of empathy was disheartening.\n\nThe saving grace of our experience was Lionel, a standout member of the weekday staff. He took every issue seriously and went above and beyond to resolve them. Within a few hours, he found us a superior room away from the construction noise and ensured we were well taken care of. His professionalism and genuine care made a significant difference.\n\nWe also noticed a stark contrast between the weekday and weekend staff.

Walking into the hotel, it’s beautifully adorned and sets the tone for a good stay, for a 4 star hotel. However upon check in is where the problems started. We booked on booking dot com and paid in advance, however the staff (front office manager) asked for my credit card for payment. I told her we’d already paid in full upfront and she snarly said “I don’t think so”…. I told her to double check and she said oh yeah… no apology for the remark. Strange how the front office manager could make such error.. had I not checked, I would have been charged again.\nWe made our way up to the room… an hour later I had a call saying that my AMEX card was in the lobby as the staff didn’t return it to me.

Not one smile, not an apology.\nThe next day, the shower gel was not replenished, despite us using it all. The amenities are not up to standard for a 4 star hotel at a price of over 200€ per night. After the second night, still no replies of shower gel so I complained to the front office. Again, no apology, the staff just scrabbled to find a spare small bottle of shower gel in the drawer at front office. Besides this, there are no cotton buds or any other basic amenities you’d expect, no kettle, no tea or coffee, no water.  I have had better amenities in 2 star hotels. This hotel is 2 star parading as 4 star just because they have a restaurant onsite and a concierge service.\n\nUpon checkout we were asked how many rooms, and how many adults in the room.. strange questions. No thank you for the stay or any form of sincerity.\n\nLocation is fantastic and the lobby and restaurant are beautiful. Complete let down from the staff (apart from bellboy who is friendly).\n\nMy advice to management: stop being so cheap and greedy.

The way they talk wasn’t polite either. Our experience for breakfast was very good and the stuff were outstanding. The room was a disappointment. In my personal opinion it was not worth the money. The sheets were dirty in check-in and bathroom wasn’t very clean either. We came on winter and the room was freezing as the windows don’t have double glazing. You could feel the breeze around. Also behind the tv they had a pocket inside the wall to allocate all the cables. Somethings must have happened to the cover for it. They only put some tape over it instead.

They call themselves 5 stars? More like 0 stars. Here’s why:\n1- Health Hazard: I’m pregnant and planned to stay six nights. Within hours, I had a severe allergic reaction—turns out the bedsheets were dirty. You’d think a hotel charging €1,000 per night could afford clean laundry. Apparently not.\n\n2- Ridiculous Management: While I stood outside feeling miserable from the allergic reaction, instead of offering help or sympathy, they had the nerve to sell me another room for an extra €600 per night. Oh, sure, because €1,000 per night wasn’t already enough, right? Maybe the €600 room came with fresh bedsheets this time? Or perhaps the staff personally fluff your pillow while insulting you in the process? We’ll never know, because no sane person would fall for that scam.\n\n3- The Arrogant “Superstar” Staff: The young woman at the front desk must think she’s auditioning for a reality TV show because she acted like an arrogant diva instead of someone working in hospitality. Her attitude was as luxurious as a cheap motel off the highway. If she’s the face of their 5-star service, this hotel is in serious trouble.\n\n4- Basic Failures: It took FIVE HOURS to get our luggage to the room. Maybe they were busy brainstorming new ways to scam guests out of €600? And don’t even get me started on their nightclub-like entrance. It screams, “We’re trying way too hard to be trendy,” but ends up just feeling cheap and tacky.\n\n5- Lost and Found Comedy Show: We forgot a hat in the room. They found it but didn’t bother to let us know. I had to go back TWICE to beg for it. Eventually, someone at the desk made a dramatic phone call, and voilà—the hat magically appeared. Maybe they thought we’d pay €600 to get it back too?\n\nThis hotel is a joke.

While they were doing it their behavior was extremely unfriendly, unprofessional and arrogant. After our pleasant dinner, when we went to exit the place, we were once again faced with the rude receptionists and waited for them to notice us and give us our coats, which almost caused us miss our uber. The fact that the place was almost empty means their behavior intentional, and when we said our taxi was leaving and we were in a hurry, the response of the receptionist was “and what can I do about that”.

I had the scallops, which were cooked to perfection and accompanied by a rich and flavorful white wine butter sauce—an absolute delight! However, I’d recommend skipping the deviled eggs if you’re American. Unlike the traditional U.S. preparation, the mayo isn’t mixed with the egg yolk; instead, it’s piped on top. This resulted in a mouthful of mayo, which I found a bit overwhelming. It may simply reflect how deviled eggs are prepared in Europe, but it wasn’t quite to my taste.\n\nBottom line: If you’re seeking a refined dining experience after shopping at Louis Vuitton or exploring the shops along the Champs-Élysées, Brasserie Fouquet’s is an excellent choice.

L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon Étoile - Champs-Élysées,"30 Rue Vernet, 75008 Paris, France",48.8723948,2.2970713,2138,4.3,"['My wife and I had a reservation right when they opened at 7 pm. We really enjoyed passing through the market/drugstore upstairs before going downstairs to the restaurant. We really loved the ambience, with a distinct black and red decor at the counters and throughout. We waited about 5 minutes before being seated at the counter. Note to everyone: bar/counter seating is part of the experience. If you want a super formal and intimate fine dining experience, reserve a table in the private dining area way ahead, or don’t go here. The laidback style was what my wife and I actually preferred, while getting to watch the masters at work in the kitchen. Staff was great to us, made us feel very welcome, even as Americans. As expected, the sommelier at first came off a little intimidating, first offering us a glass of champagne to kick off the night. We were then given our amuse bouche, which was like a Parmesan truffle soup with melted foie grois on the inside, it was insanely decadent and delicious, accompanied with delicious bread and butter. We decided to forego the pre-fix option (which looked great) as I wanted to try dishes that stood out to me. After ordering, the sommmelier recommended a nice bottle of white to pair with our all seafood choices. I requested the lowest priced bottle of the white Burgundy (~€150), to which he replied they were out of. He proceeded to then recommend another white to us that would be comparable, which much to my surprise was in fact much cheaper than the bottle we requested (~€95) and was perfect with our food. He also warmed up to us throughout the night, and we enjoyed interacting with him, contrary to other opinions I had seen before booking. First we started with the caviar, in which they brought us out a baseball sized dish of caviar with blinis and toppings. It was by far the most caviar we had been served at a restaurant before, and pretty self explanatory: delicious and decadent and paired perfectly with our champagne. Next we had the crispy langoustines, which were incredible. Somehow fried but insanely succulent, juicy, and tender as butter, paired with done great sauces. The chef was gracious enough to give us an extra so we could each have two, since we were sharing. Next was the roasted lobster with stuffed heads. Again, probably my favorite lobster dish I’ve had, we each got half of the lobster and paired with delicious shoe string fries with a delicious aioli. Last, was THE main event: the Dover sole. It was the best fish we have ever eaten hand down, with our waiter expertly dissecting and deboning it right in front of us with a fork and spoon. This was the whole reason we came, and it exceeded expectations. On top of that, it was accompanied by the iconic Robuchon potato puree (mashed potatoes), and live up to their name as best in the world. We finished with a delicious chocolate dessert and coffee. They also capped the night off by giving us a freshly baked tray of madeleines, which were warm, soft and delicious. Note to customers: you will be asked about a tip when checking out. We didn’t care, because we felt they were deserving of one, but I know this can rub some people the wrong way. Furthermore, it’s a Michelin starred establishment, so it wasn’t cheap. But we anticipated this and came to not hold back. You get what you pay for. The only critique we would have is better cutlery. The langoustines needed a knife to cut through the fried outer layer, and the knives were less sharp than a butter knife. Overall we had an amazing night and enjoyed every aspect of our dinner at the counter. I also have to say that we were impressed with the portion sizes for it being a fine dining establishment. We actually probably ordered too much food for the two of us, but everything was so delicious, we managed to finish all of our dishes.. We hope we can visit again one day to have the Dover sole again and try some of their other innovative and delicious dishes.', 'We had a delightful meal at this restaurant. We enjoyed all of the dishes and the wine. Of particular note were the fish of the day (monkfish), langoustine ravioli with foie gras and the butter was just lovely.\n\nThe downfall of the restaurant is the service, while the staff are lovely, the service is very slow and at points absent. We didn’t mind too much as we lavished a longer lunch with two bottles of lovely wine.\n\nUltimately, we had a wonderful meal.', ""I travel regularly and make it a point to enjoy some of the best cuisine I can find, both for the joy of the meal and to experience another beautiful facet of the human panoply. In every regard, L'Atelier de Robuchon excelled. It is in contention for my favorite meal of all time and I hope to return many, many times. The service was superb and, unlike what one may expect from a restaurant of this class, the staff was humble, approachable, and went above and beyond to ensure every need was anticipated and met. Each bite and sip was delectable, particularly for items recommended by the server and sommelier. For those on the fence about indulging in a fine dining experience while in Paris, consider this a push. Pricey for those traveling on a budget like I am, but worth every cent."", 'Great food, great service, great wine\nThe restaurant was a bit hard to find though ,well hidden in a drugstore.\nWe had the lunch menu , for a lot (most) of choices you have to pay extra,i wonder why they don’t just raise the price for the menu.\nWould definitely come back here.', 'Incredible meal, the food and wine pairings were perfect, the staff was friendly, attentive, and informative.

He gave us fantastic recommendations for restaurants and got us into some lovely spots for dinners.\n\nOur room was nice and very spacious. The bed, however, was very uncomfortable for what I’m used to (it was very very hard).', 'Perfect hotel. Perfect and friendly location, feeling of security in the hotel, nice staff who answered all requests, delicious breakfast, clean and beautiful rooms. Highly recommended my experience in Paris thanks to the hotel and I wanted to thank Charles Part, one of the owners, for the good service.', 'It all started the moment we arrived. Walking into the hotel, it’s beautifully adorned and sets the tone for a good stay, for a 4 star hotel. However upon check in is where the problems started. We booked on booking dot com and paid in advance, however the staff (front office manager) asked for my credit card for payment. I told her we’d already paid in full upfront and she snarly said “I don’t think so”…. I told her to double check and she said oh yeah… no apology for the remark. Strange how the front office manager could make such error.. had I not checked, I would have been charged again.\nWe made our way up to the room… an hour later I had a call saying that my AMEX card was in the lobby as the staff didn’t return it to me. They didn’t bring it to the room or apologise, so I made my way down to collect it.\nThe entire aura and lack of manners from the staff is disappointing. Not one smile, not an apology.\nThe next day, the shower gel was not replenished, despite us using it all. The amenities are not up to standard for a 4 star hotel at a price of over 200€ per night. After the second night, still no replies of shower gel so I complained to the front office. Again, no apology, the staff just scrabbled to find a spare small bottle of shower gel in the drawer at front office. Besides this, there are no cotton buds or any other basic amenities you’d expect, no kettle, no tea or coffee, no water.  I have had better amenities in 2 star hotels. This hotel is 2 star parading as 4 star just because they have a restaurant onsite and a concierge service.\n\nUpon checkout we were asked how many rooms, and how many adults in the room.. strange questions. No thank you for the stay or any form of sincerity.\n\nLocation is fantastic and the lobby and restaurant are beautiful. Complete let down from the staff (apart from bellboy who is friendly).\n\nMy advice to management: stop being so cheap and greedy. Provide proper amenities that reflect the level and cost of the hotel. Train your staff or hire people that actually want to be in hospitality.\nAlso, bed sheets and carpet have stains and holes. Not acceptable.', 'Good place , but I hated that the toilet is separate from the shower and sink! Imagine using the toilet then need to open tow doors to wash your hands.. there is no slippers, rope, tooth brush, water, or coffee corner.. if you need boiling water you need to go to the lobby to have one otherwise they will charge you for room service if they bring it to you.. the last thing about the open buffet I didn’t like it at all ( eggs, yogurt, cereal, mini croissants, sausages, and a small plate with 3 type of cheese only!! ) and it was pricey']",9e

I didn’t have any issues with the hotel but it’s definitely not a 4 star hotel. It’s a small, boutique hotel that I would classify as 3 stars. First, there isn’t even a lobby with a reception area. There’s a communal dining table with a staff member and a laptop who checks you in. I completely didn’t even realize they were staff because they blended in with the other patrons who were using the dining table. I had room 31 which is fine for a solo traveler, but definitely not for a couple. It’s small and inconveniently designed. There’s no door from the sleeping area to the shower and sink. The toilet is a separate, closed off area, away from the sink which I would find awkward if I was sharing with a partner or a friend.The lobby also hosts a club and many DJ’s so it tends to get quite loud and packed at night. There are also plenty of clubs on the same street that I could hear at night when I’m trying to sleep. It wasn’t really an issue for me because I can sleep through anything, but I can see how that would be a problem for other guests.']",9e

They call themselves 5 stars? More like 0 stars. Here’s why:\n1- Health Hazard: I’m pregnant and planned to stay six nights. Within hours, I had a severe allergic reaction—turns out the bedsheets were dirty. You’d think a hotel charging €1,000 per night could afford clean laundry. Apparently not.\n\n2- Ridiculous Management: While I stood outside feeling miserable from the allergic reaction, instead of offering help or sympathy, they had the nerve to sell me another room for an extra €600 per night. Oh, sure, because €1,000 per night wasn’t already enough, right? Maybe the €600 room came with fresh bedsheets this time? Or perhaps the staff personally fluff your pillow while insulting you in the process? We’ll never know, because no sane person would fall for that scam.\n\n3- The Arrogant “Superstar” Staff: The young woman at the front desk must think she’s auditioning for a reality TV show because she acted like an arrogant diva instead of someone working in hospitality. Her attitude was as luxurious as a cheap motel off the highway. If she’s the face of their 5-star service, this hotel is in serious trouble.\n\n4- Basic Failures: It took FIVE HOURS to get our luggage to the room. Maybe they were busy brainstorming new ways to scam guests out of €600? And don’t even get me started on their nightclub-like entrance. It screams, “We’re trying way too hard to be trendy,” but ends up just feeling cheap and tacky.\n\n5- Lost and Found Comedy Show: We forgot a hat in the room. They found it but didn’t bother to let us know. I had to go back TWICE to beg for it. Eventually, someone at the desk made a dramatic phone call, and voilà—the hat magically appeared. Maybe they thought we’d pay €600 to get it back too?\n\nThis hotel is a joke. Save yourself the headache (and the allergic reaction) and stay somewhere that actually understands what hospitality means.

While they were doing it their behavior was extremely unfriendly, unprofessional and arrogant. After our pleasant dinner, when we went to exit the place, we were once again faced with the rude receptionists and waited for them to notice us and give us our coats, which almost caused us miss our uber.

Standout item for a few of us was the Duck. You’ve probably had it elsewhere in Paris as it’s a staple dish in most restaurants. I would say the Duck here was the best one I had in Paris. Fairly generous in portion and cooked to perfection. Only note to add is that they could use more sauce on the duck.\nThe Foie gras ravioli was a bit too heavy for me and it’s not traditional ravioli but more foie gras and long lengthy pasta noodle.\nWe would not recommend the cod fish pasta/risotto which was just underwhelming.\nHighly recommend their desserts especially the chocolate brioche cake. That was the best dessert out of the ones they offered.']",9e

Our story was that we wanted to go to a restaurant that had nice food and which has dancy dancy music that we could enjoy after dinner. Our observations are as following:\n- too loud to have dinner here, even if the dancing area was not open yet, the music was very loud the whole evening\n- the waiting time for the food was a nightmare... we waited 2 HOURS for the first appetizers to come and they still missed one plate... Then we had to rush between main dish and dessert because they were already cleaning the tables around so the party could start\n- the food was ok, the cocktails were ok too, but the waiting time for the cocktails was long as well\n- it is a good place to dance if you are into that specific music\nThe conclusion is that they are VERY understaffed as we were sitting exactly next to the open kitchen and we could see the cooks were preparing dishes non-stop. The waiters were running around non-stop as well, but the place had so many clients that it was not human for them to face it all.', ""I've been there with my colleagues. The food was great!

If you’re going to charge that much for tea, it should at least be served hot.

The sauce would make any risotto amazing but it works so beautifully with the undercooked potato that it makes perfect sense for you to experiment with potatoes more at home. On the other hand, you may just think that the undercooked potato is nothing to get excited about and hate the dish.\n\nIt’s a special place for a reasonably prepared foodie and its informal atmosphere, at least to me, makes it easier to enjoy the chefs craft.', 'Well we got so lucky getting walked in spot I btw tried a month before arriving.

Between my daughter and myself we’ve eaten here five times in the last seven years. It is one of our go to restaurants in Paris. We love the atmosphere and the food has always been good. Our most recent visit on a Monday night was a little disappointing. Two reasons for the dissatisfaction. First, the tall thin bartender/hostess was not friendly or welcoming. I’m quite comfortable pairing and ordering wine, but I will often ask for suggestions from the wait staff. She was either unable or disinterested in helping and reacted negatively when I didn’t want the most expensive bottle. Second issue was that the one thing two of us came here for was the burger and they were “out.” Not sure how you can be “out” of hamburger and buns - you’re within blocks of dozens of butcher shops and bakeries. Seems a lack of effort on management’s part. Other than that, the young man serving us was friendly and good at his job.

We also had the fish that was beautifully presented, opened and stuffed with the vegetables.

It’s unfair to see independent cinemas struggle while mainstream theatres continue to charge such high rates for mainstream movies. Entertainment and culture should be accessible to everyone, but this cinema seems to prioritize profit over a quality experience.\n\nThe screen did respect the original format (movie was l\'IA du mal), and the Dolby sound was goos, but these small positives and standard quality requirements can’t make up for the overall disappointment.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they charge €4 for a small packet of sweets, and honestly, it’s scandalous that nothing in the cinema is priced below €4! The atmosphere? Bland and uninspired. The space feels cold and lifeless, with none of the warmth or charm you’d expect from a cinema. The safety guards were pleasant, but the cashier was condescending and made me feel anything but welcome.\n\nI won’t be returning, and I highly recommend finding an alternative if you want a better cinema experience. This place isn’t worth the hype or the price.', 'I really enjoyed this theater.  It’s the most comfortable cinema experience that I’ve had in Paris.

The waiter we had struggled a bit due to minimal English but eventually got our order. The food came out very quickly, they were very simple French dishes, which I did not mind. The dessert which I had was something with cream cheese, but turned out to just be plain cream cheese, which I did not eat. As the other reviews mentioned, the best attribute of the restaurant is the cheap pricing. The restaurant itself is actually pretty cool inside, authentic and well preserved since the 1900s. Unfortunately after all the meals were served it took so long to get the bill and pay -almost 30 minutes. I don't blame the server as we can see him running around serving all the other tables and it was very busy. Overall it was a good experience but not my type of dining so will not go again.

The corridor was tight and dark, looked like some kind of deposit. The receptionist admitted that they had complains about the mismatching of pictures. We booked 4 nights there but had to walk around in the city at 8 pm in an unknown country because we couldn’t stay there so we needed An alternative. Although they did offered us “a better room”, I don’t understand why they didn’t put us there in the first place?

Then with less than 24 hours notice we got an email from NIKOS TSOLAKIS to advise that ""The hotel campanile of Tour Eiffel is shut, closed for renovation""?! Plus this email was sent from a different email address from all the previous email communications - so we thought it was a scam! Having landed at Gare du Nord, we thought to call the hotel to confirm if it was a scam or not. Noone answered our call to the hotel, so we called the Campanile Bookings number - to be advised that the hotel was indeed closed => so we had no hotel for tonight, or the next 3 nights either! In addition, the Campanile Booking person said he could not help us reserve an alternative hotel!! So we gave up and luckily managed to get a room @ the Ibis Paris Tour Eiffel Cambronne instead ... but 50% more expensive!! a VERY UNHAPPY Campanile customer!

Astrance,"32 Rue de Longchamp, 75116 Paris, France",48.8650824,2.2898578,400,4.5,"['Had a great dinner here.  After having a 7 course dinner yesterday we knew it was the wrong way to go and expressed it to our waiter.  He suggested we go with the 4 course, the Saison for $175 per person.  Started out with some cracker and mini bread.  Both very tasty.  Then it was off to the oyster, clam, snail dish.  The oyster had some chopped celery on the bottom that made the oyster that much better.  The snail was great.  The clam was cleaned and chopped up and served in a half shell with juice.  Very good. Then on the side there was raw fish on some thyme seasoning.  Delicious!  Then they served a piece of mini toast with shrimp integrated into it.  Love the taste!  Reminds me of dried shrimp.  I didn’t take a picture of the bread they served with butter on the side.  But the outside crunch was amazing and the aroma when it is in your mouth, fantastic!  Next was Japanese rice in lobster soup.  Could have been a little bit more flavorful, but good.  It was sourced with some cucumber in a roll.  Very flavorful.  Next was lobster.  It was a little under cooked.  But if you eat it with the garnish, it is an amazing combination.  Different flavors with each combination.  Very good.  It was served with a bowl of fresh coco beans in broth.  They were good.  The broth was heavenly.  Next was a fish dish.  The chef served this to us because of what we told him before about not being able to finish the 7 courses yesterday.  So he made the decision to serve us something lighter, fish.  The fish was very tasty especially with the sauce with a soy sauce base.  They also served some picked vegetables on the side.  The petal had a lot of orange peel taste.  Time for the dessert, first the apricot was ok.  The next one was fantastic!  The pear on some kind of cookie.  The combination was amazing!  There is also a side of pear sorbet.  So good!  We were approaching our limit.  Couldn’t finish.  When we asked for the check they gave us another three desserts!  Mini grapes!  Super sweet!  The red flesh peach, my first time seeing and tasting.  It was bland after we had the grapes.  The drink in the egg was really really good.  Had jasmine flavor!  Lastly a chocolate leaf.  So good!  What an experience.  We go to meat the chef.  He came out to talk with the customers to see how they are doing and how we like the food.  I love it when the chef takes some time out to interact with their clients.  Bravo.  Highly recommend this restaurant.  This was the best of all the 4 Michelin restaurants we went to in Paris.', 'What an incredible experience in this restaurant. The restaurant itself was beautiful, the staff were so welcoming and made everything that much better, Chef Barbot is amazing and his kitchen staff are very talented.

Follow me for all the reviews and updates on every Michelin Stars in Paris and every 3 Stars in France.\n\nThe return of the prodigal son\nWhat’s interesting here?\nThe trivia is that this restaurant in its previous location had up to 3 stars (it had 2 right before he closed before COVID). Hence the pricing and the crowd. I never went to the previous version and for a first time I took the lunch menu. I know, I’m cheap… 125€ lunch menu cheap. But the good news is that the wine list is full of good surprises. I didn’t take advantage of the it that day but I noticed some interesting bottles. The other nice touches is that the chef goes and greets every tables.\nFor the rest, I think I was still thinking of a two stars I was a few days before and I may not have been focused enough.\n\nThe service was nice, I saw some familiar faces from a palace.

It came highly recommended. While I was not as impressed with the food, that is all personal preferences which I understand.\n\nMy rating is solely based on the experience and service. The service itself started fantastic, very attentive, what you’d typically expect of a Michelin experience; however two things were major flags in my book:\n1. We were seated at 8:30, meaning our dinner finished around 10:30, right around the time of another table (I’m guessing VIPs based on the attentiveness of the staff). It seems the entire wait staff took them for a tour of the kitchen, leaving us alone in the dining area for 25 minutes waiting for our check.\n2. The check was startling. We ordered the Astrance menu (7-8 courses) with the wine pairing. We’ve been to quite a few Michelin restaurants and I’ve never been charged for my first glass of champagne or tea at the end of my meal. It felt very cheap. These things should be included in a $1000+ meal. To nickel and dime your guests in this way did not feel up to the Michelin standard.\n\nAll in all, I’m giving this review as feedback. Like I said, we wanted to love it as we chose Astrance to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I am sad we’re disappointed.']",16e

Every time we thought we knew something about the next course, we turned out to be wrong - in delightful way. Slam dunks: desserts, wine, poultry, service, stomach. On point: seafood and sushi dishes. Would have liked to see a beef dish.', 'An extraordinary example of balanced French cuisine! The service was courteous and natural, adding to the overall experience. I opted for the *De Pre* tasting menu, which was paired with a recommended champagne that complemented every course beautifully. While the wine selection was extensive, I felt that the digital format of the drink menu clashed with the restaurant\'s elegant style. My only regret was not having the opportunity to personally convey my impressions to the chef—a common practice in other two- or three-Michelin-starred restaurants —and I also missed receiving a copy of the menu as a keepsake.\nThe tasting journey began with a signature dish: lobster cappuccino. The umami-rich flavor made for a standout start, and upon my compliment, I was even treated to an additional serving. Next came a delicately crafted tapioca risotto, cooked in jellyfish sauce, which offered a gentle and refined taste. The bread and butter exceeded expectations with their exceptional quality, tempting me throughout the meal.\nThe seafood courses continued to impress. The sautéed scallops with rosemary butter were flavorful, though not entirely authentic, while the marinated scallop carpaccio with hazelnut vinegar jus and smoked mustard was a thrilling highlight. The bouillabaisse, presented as a creamy velouté with added ""rouille"" paste and bottarga, was both intense and seductive. Another standout was the hot crab jelly, served in a dashi broth with fennel cream and caviar—silky, delicate, and bursting with flavor.\nThe lobster course was pure luxury. A Brittany lobster tail was encased in a thin pastry resembling ravioli, topped with foie gras-enriched jelly and gold leaf. Surrounding it was a velvety velouté sauce enriched with foie gras. While extravagant and harmonious, the edible gold felt unnecessary. The cod ""brandade,"" served on a base of mashed potatoes with a touch of burnt garlic and seaweed, was elegantly intense and one of the meal\'s highlights.\nOther notable dishes included cherry wood-smoked salmon prepared at a low temperature with wasabi cream and toasted sesame—subtle and refined—and champagne sorbet topped with caviar, which felt delightfully indulgent. The pigeon dish featured poached pigeon breasts with honey and dates, complemented by a sauce made from pigeon bones, delivering an intense yet elegant sweetness.\nThe cheese course was innovative, with a Comté cheese soufflé in a truffle-infused sauce that was both unique and impactful. For dessert, the caramelized apple in the form of a kadaif-inspired tart, paired with apple purée and vanilla sorbet, was both beautiful and inventive. Finally, the ""Pollen"" dessert—a honey sorbet paired with a pollen sponge cake, lemon marmalade, and yogurt mousse—was a well-balanced and satisfying conclusion to the meal.\nOverall, this dining experience showcased exceptional craftsmanship, creativity, and precision, with a few minor areas for improvement.

This hamburger period will finish on June 4!\n\nThis is truly the worst news of this month for me. I decided to post this comment, because poeple should not miss this occasion.\n\nThis hamburger will be a phantom burger in the future and I’m sure you’ll be proud of having eaten this hamburger in the future.\n\nI certainly will miss this burger.😢\n(Sophisticated finely grilled beef one, looking like hundreds of shirimp stuffed shirimp one....tremendously yammy).\n\nAppendix -I found out that after confinement they renew takeout menu and will continue to tekeouts!\n\nSadly, the humbergers became phantom menus, but I’m very much excited to have their renewaled dishes!\n\nThe desserts are extremely tasty and wonderful!\nThe other day, I tasted pineapple and mango dessert and japanese miso mousse, which is extraordinary.\n\nYou’ll be amazed at how Chef create these desserts.\n\nAdditionally, ex President applauses this restaurant so much.\n\nお魚の処理の巧さがさすが日本人シェフ。']",16e

I had to ask for water twice, and we were just pouring it ourselves by the end - we had no trouble being refilled in wine though, which was great - we ordered only a glass at first but then expanded to multiple bottles and they didn't nitpick us about glass/bottle pricing. We had the macaroni - highly recommended(i daresay pushed) by the waitstaff: good but not noteworthy. I had the veal chop- I didn't like it,  and there were only four gnocchi. The chop was at least quite big and filling- my husband and brother had the beef and although they liked it, they werent wowed, and they were still hungry. The dessert we got was fantastic! My favorite plate by far (i cant remember what it was). The crepes suzanne was being prepared at the table next to us and it looked extravagant, i was quite jealous. My biggest disappointment was the french bread - hard as a rock - and obviously i came to paris to have good bread. At least i had good wine, and a gorgeous view.""]",16e

Walking into the hotel, it’s beautifully adorned and sets the tone for a good stay, for a 4 star hotel. However upon check in is where the problems started. We booked on booking dot com and paid in advance, however the staff (front office manager) asked for my credit card for payment. I told her we’d already paid in full upfront and she snarly said “I don’t think so”…. I told her to double check and she said oh yeah… no apology for the remark. Strange how the front office manager could make such error.. had I not checked, I would have been charged again.\nWe made our way up to the room… an hour later I had a call saying that my AMEX card was in the lobby as the staff didn’t return it to me. They didn’t bring it to the room or apologise, so I made my way down to collect it.\nThe entire aura and lack of manners from the staff is disappointing. Not one smile, not an apology.\nThe next day, the shower gel was not replenished, despite us using it all. The amenities are not up to standard for a 4 star hotel at a price of over 200€ per night. After the second night, still no replies of shower gel so I complained to the front office. Again, no apology, the staff just scrabbled to find a spare small bottle of shower gel in the drawer at front office. Besides this, there are no cotton buds or any other basic amenities you’d expect, no kettle, no tea or coffee, no water.  I have had better amenities in 2 star hotels. This hotel is 2 star parading as 4 star just because they have a restaurant onsite and a concierge service.\n\nUpon checkout we were asked how many rooms, and how many adults in the room.. strange questions. No thank you for the stay or any form of sincerity.\n\nLocation is fantastic and the lobby and restaurant are beautiful. Complete let down from the staff (apart from bellboy who is friendly).\n\nMy advice to management: stop being so cheap and greedy. Provide proper amenities that reflect the level and cost of the hotel. Train your staff or hire people that actually want to be in hospitality.\nAlso, bed sheets and carpet have stains and holes. Not acceptable.', 'Good place , but I hated that the toilet is separate from the shower and sink! Imagine using the toilet then need to open tow doors to wash your hands.. there is no slippers, rope, tooth brush, water, or coffee corner.. if you need boiling water you need to go to the lobby to have one otherwise they will charge you for room service if they bring it to you.. the last thing about the open buffet I didn’t like it at all ( eggs, yogurt, cereal, mini croissants, sausages, and a small plate with 3 type of cheese only!! ) and it was pricey']",17e

I had the scallops, which were cooked to perfection and accompanied by a rich and flavorful white wine butter sauce—an absolute delight! However, I’d recommend skipping the deviled eggs if you’re American. Unlike the traditional U.S. preparation, the mayo isn’t mixed with the egg yolk; instead, it’s piped on top. This resulted in a mouthful of mayo, which I found a bit overwhelming.

We had oysters, fish soup with rouille and crouton, sausage, smoked pork belly sauerkraut, roast chicken. Oysters were fresh, chicken dry, and sausage sauerkraut average. I’m giving service 1-star because the waiter Luciano said “American high tips”. When he brought the credit card machine he asked for 20 euros tips with a smile  I don’t mind giving tips for good service which he did provide. However, I was taken aback by such a direct ask which I thought was in poor taste. I pointed to the bill which clearly states that 15% service charge has been added. His action made a negative impression to me that Wepler was tourist trap. I can honestly say I’ve never had an experience where waiter asked me to give him a specific tips amount. Before I left I shared this incident with a manager because I thought the waiter made the restaurant look bad.', 'What a surprise! Huge place with a nice buzz, not too loud, everyone sort of funnily peeks into the neighbors dishes.. service is pro and nice, the food was delicious.

L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon Étoile - Champs-Élysées,"30 Rue Vernet, 75008 Paris, France",48.8723948,2.2970713,2138,4.3,"['My wife and I had a reservation right when they opened at 7 pm. We really enjoyed passing through the market/drugstore upstairs before going downstairs to the restaurant. We really loved the ambience, with a distinct black and red decor at the counters and throughout. We waited about 5 minutes before being seated at the counter. Note to everyone: bar/counter seating is part of the experience. If you want a super formal and intimate fine dining experience, reserve a table in the private dining area way ahead, or don’t go here. The laidback style was what my wife and I actually preferred, while getting to watch the masters at work in the kitchen. Staff was great to us, made us feel very welcome, even as Americans. As expected, the sommelier at first came off a little intimidating, first offering us a glass of champagne to kick off the night. We were then given our amuse bouche, which was like a Parmesan truffle soup with melted foie grois on the inside, it was insanely decadent and delicious, accompanied with delicious bread and butter. We decided to forego the pre-fix option (which looked great) as I wanted to try dishes that stood out to me. After ordering, the sommmelier recommended a nice bottle of white to pair with our all seafood choices. I requested the lowest priced bottle of the white Burgundy (~€150), to which he replied they were out of. He proceeded to then recommend another white to us that would be comparable, which much to my surprise was in fact much cheaper than the bottle we requested (~€95) and was perfect with our food. He also warmed up to us throughout the night, and we enjoyed interacting with him, contrary to other opinions I had seen before booking. First we started with the caviar, in which they brought us out a baseball sized dish of caviar with blinis and toppings. It was by far the most caviar we had been served at a restaurant before, and pretty self explanatory: delicious and decadent and paired perfectly with our champagne. Next we had the crispy langoustines, which were incredible. Somehow fried but insanely succulent, juicy, and tender as butter, paired with done great sauces. The chef was gracious enough to give us an extra so we could each have two, since we were sharing. Next was the roasted lobster with stuffed heads. Again, probably my favorite lobster dish I’ve had, we each got half of the lobster and paired with delicious shoe string fries with a delicious aioli. Last, was THE main event: the Dover sole. It was the best fish we have ever eaten hand down, with our waiter expertly dissecting and deboning it right in front of us with a fork and spoon. This was the whole reason we came, and it exceeded expectations. On top of that, it was accompanied by the iconic Robuchon potato puree (mashed potatoes), and live up to their name as best in the world. We finished with a delicious chocolate dessert and coffee. They also capped the night off by giving us a freshly baked tray of madeleines, which were warm, soft and delicious. Note to customers: you will be asked about a tip when checking out. We didn’t care, because we felt they were deserving of one, but I know this can rub some people the wrong way. Furthermore, it’s a Michelin starred establishment, so it wasn’t cheap. But we anticipated this and came to not hold back. You get what you pay for. The only critique we would have is better cutlery. The langoustines needed a knife to cut through the fried outer layer, and the knives were less sharp than a butter knife. Overall we had an amazing night and enjoyed every aspect of our dinner at the counter. I also have to say that we were impressed with the portion sizes for it being a fine dining establishment. We actually probably ordered too much food for the two of us, but everything was so delicious, we managed to finish all of our dishes.. We hope we can visit again one day to have the Dover sole again and try some of their other innovative and delicious dishes.', 'We had a delightful meal at this restaurant. We enjoyed all of the dishes and the wine. Of particular note were the fish of the day (monkfish), langoustine ravioli with foie gras and the butter was just lovely.\n\nThe downfall of the restaurant is the service, while the staff are lovely, the service is very slow and at points absent. We didn’t mind too much as we lavished a longer lunch with two bottles of lovely wine.\n\nUltimately, we had a wonderful meal.', ""I travel regularly and make it a point to enjoy some of the best cuisine I can find, both for the joy of the meal and to experience another beautiful facet of the human panoply. In every regard, L'Atelier de Robuchon excelled. It is in contention for my favorite meal of all time and I hope to return many, many times. The service was superb and, unlike what one may expect from a restaurant of this class, the staff was humble, approachable, and went above and beyond to ensure every need was anticipated and met. Each bite and sip was delectable, particularly for items recommended by the server and sommelier. For those on the fence about indulging in a fine dining experience while in Paris, consider this a push. Pricey for those traveling on a budget like I am, but worth every cent."", 'Great food, great service, great wine\nThe restaurant was a bit hard to find though ,well hidden in a drugstore.\nWe had the lunch menu , for a lot (most) of choices you have to pay extra,i wonder why they don’t just raise the price for the menu.\nWould definitely come back here.', 'Incredible meal, the food and wine pairings were perfect, the staff was friendly, attentive, and informative.

I found it odd, it didn't take half as long as I was made to believe, I would soon find out.\nNo too long after, a few guests of what will become a big party, started arriving. They will occupy most of the seats close to us, perhaps all of the sudden we got in the middle of this and they thought they will be overwhelmed. No excuses, there is no reason to treat your guests poorly or rude. We felt unwelcome, rushed, very dissatisfied. The food wasn't bad, in fact I enjoyed the main course, not as good as I would have if the personal experience would have been different.\nAt the end, we asked for the check and left, no desert no nothing, we weren't even asked.

As a vegetarian, I was delighted to find a restaurant that offers such a diverse range of dishes, all prepared with traditional flavors and spices.\n\nI visited during lunch hours, and despite the bustling crowd, the service was efficient. The staff was polite and attentive, ensuring that orders were taken quickly and that food was served hot. The ambiance is casual, with a welcoming atmosphere that’s perfect for families and groups. The interior is simple yet clean, reflecting the no-frills approach focused on delivering quality food.\n\nThe highlight of my meal was the masala dosa—crispy, perfectly spiced, and served with a variety of chutneys and sambar. The idlis were soft and fluffy, just like they should be. I also tried their thali, which offered a delightful mix of curries, rice, and breads, giving a wholesome taste of South Indian cuisine. The portions are generous, and prices are reasonable, making it a great value for the quality and authenticity of the food.\n\nWhat I appreciate most is the consistency in taste. Being part of a global chain, Saravanaa Bhavan maintains the same high standards you’d expect in their outlets back in India. It’s clear they don’t compromise on quality, even so far from home.\n\nFor vegetarians, vegans, or anyone looking to explore South Indian flavors, Saravanaa Bhavan is definitely worth a visit.

The dosas were perfectly crispy on the outside while soft on the inside, just how they should be. The potato masala filling was flavorful, not too spicy but packed with the perfect blend of spices. The Uttapam, with its soft and fluffy texture, was a delight, especially with the assortment of toppings.\n\nBut the real highlight of the meal was the chutneys—especially the coconut chutney. I couldn't get enough of it! I ordered extra servings of the coconut chutney four times because it was that good. Fresh, creamy, and bursting with flavor, it complemented each dish perfectly. The tangy tomato chutney and the mildly spiced sambar were excellent too, but the coconut chutney stole the show.\n\nIn terms of ambiance, the place has a cozy and warm feel, with an air of simplicity that lets the food do the talking.

My father in law was too cold to stay outside, it was quite an argument because we paid for it already! The host saw us and we told him the embarrassing situation. He went to the neighboring restaurant (owned by the same owner) to seat us, to which they couldn’t. My father in law surrendered thankfully.\n\nThe manager came, he looked at us seriously, and then asked us of our culture. We shared the same culture and he could tell!\n\nRegardless they were so professional, courteous and accommodating in however they could have been.\n\nLet’s get to the food, the essential factor.\n\nFood: For appetizer we had 1 escargots, and 3 of les œufs mayonnaise.\n\nI had œufs. They were made for true love. The texture of creaminess and layers of the flavor all came together like a ballet. A ballet that could make a hater of the ballet fall in love. It had truffle, and the salad mixed in had just the right hint of balsamic vinegar to lift the flavor of the truffle which I confused for some in spicy wasabi substitute but no. It was so delicious it made start writing the review to give it 5 stars in everything already.\n\nBut that’s just the beginning.\n\nI asked Michael the manager which is his preferred entree. He said the Beef. So three of us did while one of us had the Chicken and Fries.\n\nWe understood why the restaurant had every seat filled. The beef’s tenderness was just right like the shoe on Cinderella’s foot. The sauce it was glazed in melted in your mouth like a fresh warm blanket with a tang that was truly alive.\nAnd the potatoes. Again, the texture. I wish I could explain it better but it just felt like they were given the precise time and temperature mix up to remind you that cooking truly is a science as well as it is an art. They brought bread both for the appetizer and for the entree which of course have not missed once since we have been in France. We used it to complement every centimeter of sauce left in that plate. The carrots and mushrooms couldn’t be forgotten either as it was a symphony.\n\nThe chicken was perfectly cooked, of course, fall off the bone. Glazed with a sauce that was like a peanut sauce and it really was so fancy. I tried just a bit of it, and the fries with it did not miss.\n\nYou think I’m being extra? Overdramatic? Look at the picture of the beef and potatoes. Michael had places mine on the table for me. He carefully adjusted the plate so that the text on the plate would face me correctly. So no I am not being ridiculous. Everything here was ridiculously good. The epitome of what is fine dining. The taste struck that moment to me in ratatouille where the food critic goes back to his childhood. I’m not kidding.\n\nNow the dessert. The. Crème Brûlée, was like no other. The top crust, standard deliciousness, can’t change how that goes. The crème, was almost curated? How did they do it? Almost like they pre toasted the milk? They literally gave the crème layers to its richness. The slight chill of it reminded me I’m not in the US.\n\nMichael talked with us for quite a while through it all. This place is no joke. The oldest operating restaurant in Place du Tertre. Birth place of the word Bistro, and so much more rich history. Frequented by many popular public figures, and truly, a part of my history for my family we will not forget. Thank you Michael and thank you to your staff, your chefs really deserve their flowers.

The staff was polite and attentive, ensuring that orders were taken quickly and that food was served hot. The ambiance is casual, with a welcoming atmosphere that’s perfect for families and groups. The interior is simple yet clean, reflecting the no-frills approach focused on delivering quality food.\n\nThe highlight of my meal was the masala dosa—crispy, perfectly spiced, and served with a variety of chutneys and sambar. The idlis were soft and fluffy, just like they should be. I also tried their thali, which offered a delightful mix of curries, rice, and breads, giving a wholesome taste of South Indian cuisine. The portions are generous, and prices are reasonable, making it a great value for the quality and authenticity of the food.\n\nWhat I appreciate most is the consistency in taste.
