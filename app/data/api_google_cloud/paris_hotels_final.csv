They were stuck at different levels. then the only way down with the lift that barely worked was to go all the way up and then down to ground level. caused major stress and delay. people have places to be, flights to catch. it’ll be hard to carry a 25kg suitcase down 6 flights of stairs. get them fixed.', 'After reading many negative comments, we had a very good expectation management before our stay during the Olympics period. The staff in the front desk was kind and polite. He allocated us a room that we could enjoy a view of Eiffel Tower. The size of the room was reasonable. If anyone says the room is small, he/she must have not been to Tokyo. I welcomed the separated WC and shower place. However, the WC was too small. There was a hole in the shower screen door that water would inevitably spill out. It was a bit tricky. Yes, since the shower screen door was almost transparent, it could be quite embarrassing if you were not travelling with your loved ones.\nThe size of the bed was very well - the pillows and duvet were good. The air-conditioning was a godsend during the very hot weather. We had good sleeps.\nThe breakfast was fine.\nIt is within 5 minutes walk between Metro 4/Tram T3a and the hotel. The Metro 4 connects major stations. Location-wide, it was really good!\nTo be fair, what do you expect for a budget hotel? I am more than happy with this price and this quality.', ""The location is a few minutes with the metro from central Paris, so it's good. And for the price, it's fine.\nOur three-person room was small, with barely any room to walk past each other. We couldn't open the window, only air condition.\nThe person om the 'bunk' bed couldn't get an extra blanket, and it just had one thin blanket. They had no spares??\nWe didn't go to the restaurant, but facilities are fine. There's a water tap and a coffee machine (that gives very little coffee), and restrooms.\nIn the room there's a small shower and a curtain that shields the shower and toilet from the rest. While someone's showering, no-one can go to the restroom. Shower and toilet work fine, but toilet door doesn't close fully and/or lock.\nThere's no common trashcan, just glas, paper and plastic. Also, when we first exited the hotel there was a mouse being chased by personnel.. but that was a one-time thing.""]",14e

We were able to leave our things in the storage room and we even had a towel in our room! Thank you for your hospitality! It was worth it 42 euros for two.

A bit of a wait to check in which I hadn’t expected at 22.30. Friendly staff and great to be able to enter your room with a code. We’d booked the cheapest room available on the F1 website which was only €52 including tourist tax on a Friday in October. Shared bathroom wasn’t a problem as it was clean, good water pressure, and no queues. Only downside was the fact that you can’t really open a window in the peripherique facing rooms because of the enormous traffic noise, even on the 6th floor. Without an open window though, the room was pretty warm and stuffy even with the heating fully off. A fan would help! Be aware that the beds in the tandem room are only 140x190 so not great if you’re big or tall.', 'We spent two nights in the hotel. The location of the hotel is great; the metro station, supermarkets, pharmacies are within short walking distance which is super great if you want to have a great time in Paris without hours of commuting.\n\nThe room itself was big and clean, however it was lacking any wardrobe or shelf that could store clothes. Our beds were comfortable and clean as well. The continental breakfast was minimalist but worth its price, it is accessible for a longer period in the morning which was so relieving.\n\nWhat we did not like was the bathroom, it was incredibly small and had no hand soap nor small towel for the hands. We also had to leave one of our ID cards at the reception in order to get a hairdryer, which we did not find fair at all.\n\nOverall I would say this is a great place for a few nights for tourists on budget and for those who want to stay within Paris and save time with public transport.', 'I don\'t have a lot to say other than I\'m glad I didn\'t pay to stay there. I helped my nephew and his son get there. He\'d reserved online quite a while ago. I don\'t know how much he paid but I\'m positive it was too much for an extremely ugly room. I\'ll post a picture of the ""interesting"" wallpaper which is everywhere. One towel per bed. Maybe there were two on the double. But that\'s it.  It spoke of hair dryers but we certainly couldn\'t find one. I noticed that in the room with two single beds pushed together like a double bed, on the side where I was sitting you couldn\'t control the light. It was on the other side of the other bed. On the other hand the plug for charging phones were on the side where I was sitting so his wire would have to go over me if I were sleeping there. There was a small bathroom and it did at least have toilet paper but nothing else such as shampoo or even hand soap. It was quite a strange place which I suppose is fine for many people but as I said I\'m glad my plans changed and I\'m on a train to another adventure.

Shower stall was very small. I\'m fairly small and short, but it was almost impossible to turn around in the shower without hitting the water handle, which either changed the temperature or the water pressure.

Every other place I\'d seen allowed cancellations with just 24-hours notice. Location was ok, though not really near a lot of attractions.

This gives significant privacy and represents a great asset.\n\nFinally, the managers of Simone VEIL take great care of the tenants and strive on a daily basis to meet their needs and requirements with efficiency and speed. For my part, each time I encountered a technical or administrative problem, my request was always resolved as quickly as possible. We really feel supported. A big thank you to the manager Madame TIDAFI for her availability, patience and kindness. Always a warm hello or a radiant smile sent to us from him. When someone loves their job, you can see and feel it. Mrs. TIDAFI loves her work and does it well for us. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. OSSENI with whom I unfortunately did not have the opportunity to exchange much but who was always present when I asked for him.\n\nIf I have one suggestion to make, it is to offer better material conditions to managers (salary increase, hiring of an assistant, etc.) so that they can continue to provide quality service (or even better quality). There are a lot of us in the residence and it is not always easy to meet all our needs. Despite all their good will, managers remain human beings and can become exhausted.\n\nIn any case, thank you for this very favorable living environment which allowed me to obtain all my diplomas up to the master's degree and to graduate as valedictorian. As they say, the environment is a determining factor for success and for my part, it strongly contributed to it. Mrs. TIDAFI and Mr. OSSENI stay as you are, don't give up, be confident in your profession!"", 'Student residence very well designed but the maintenance of the residence remains to be reviewed']",14e

Despite myself and my friend trying to leave our room in the morning, we were unable to do so. We both had functioning keys, but the door was deadbolted from the corridor. We both called the hotel several times, and called downstairs using the room phone (did not work, merely a prop), and there was again, no response. I was then forced to get someone's attention from the street in hopes they would see if the manager was downstairs, he was difficult to locate and acted dismissive towards the fact that the room was locked from the outside. This person is the only reason we were able to leave our hotel room.\n\nThe manager made his way upstairs, unlocked the door from the outside, and proceeded to block the door and chastise myself and my friend for somehow locking the door from the outside, which was impossible given the layout of the locks on the interior and exterior of the door. He eventually let us pass, and we both left. He then admitted to locking the door for security purposes, changing the story from blaming the paying guests, to saying he locks doors for security purposes. This was after repeated questions about why this happened and asking how he did not understand the safety risks associated with these actions.\n\nAside from the general terrifying nature of being locked in a room, as two young women, this manager's actions also posed a significant risk in case of emergency, such as a fire. Had that happened, there would have been no way to escape. It was abysmal service, to say the least. I would not recommend that anyone stays here.\n\nThe room was also really not habitable; the lights did not work, there was no heat, no running hot water. The manager returned to the room and dropped off an electric water boiler, not sure why - (I suspect this is when the door was locked from the outside). Room was generally dirty and there were half used hand-soap and shampoo containers in the bathroom.\n\nThe manager also got very angry at the suggestion we received bad service, in addition to his inability to take accountability for placing two paying guest in a perilous situation.

What about the money spent on sprays to treat my luggage, the cream for my bites, and the enormous stress and hassle?

The rest of the hotel was just as bad:\n\n-The showerhead didn’t even have a wall attachment.\n-There was no ventilation in the room.\n-The locks were practically useless.\n-The internet barely functioned.\n-The windows did nothing to block out noise or heat.\n\nThe entire place was filthy.

Thankfully the AC was broken and they moved us to another one, which had a smaller bathroom, still good enough, and a considerably bigger room, in which we could keep all 4 pieces (2 big and 2 carry ons) of luggage open at all times and still move.\nAnother surprise was that it had no minibar in any rooms, just a shared refrigerator downstairs in the common area in which you had to talk to someone to access, so not really feasible to store like a leftover sandwich or your day to day bottles of water.\nImportant disclaimer is that this was the first and only hotel I ever stayed in Paris, so in comparison to others there this may all be normal, but coming from experiences in Brazil and in the US, this was lackluster.\nBreakfast was good, not great, just good, a few options, some nice cheeses, coffee machine, juice, and some local pastries.\nAll in all it was an okay place to stay, I'd recommend it if the price is right (not what it was for the Olympics), and knowing the above mentioned things.

The push button in the toilet didn’t work right (it was difficult to press it, really, and if you try harder the water will go non stop). We payed 5.5k€ for 8 nights for 2 rooms.

But it is clean and comfortable. You don’t need much more to enjoy your time in this city. And with how nice the owner and staff are it is totally worth it. My wife and I are picky about where we stay and I can say the people who run the hotel make it special. If you are looking for a large room and perfect everything go to a holiday inn or other chain, but if you want friendly local people and a great experience then stay here.']",14e

Staying here has been one of the most miserable experiences of my life. When I arrived the receptionist was unfriendly and acted like I was an inconvenience to them, which I found to be quite unprofessional. I was assigned my bed, only to discover that it was already being used by someone else and so had to haul my luggage back down the stairwell and then up further to my newly assigned bed. Again, not very professional.\n\nWhen I tried plugging my travel adapter into the socket it broke. This ended up becoming quite a problem as the USB sockets for my bed specifically did not work (I checked and the USB sockets for the other beds in my room worked fine - it was just mine that did not). This meant that I was not able to charge my phone, which ran out of battery while I was searching to buy a new travel adapter. Thankfully I did not get lost.\n\nThe worst thing, however, is that on the first night I was woken up at 1AM by the receptionist asking me to confirm my name, as someone else in the room had taken the wrong bed. In my view it is, frankly, unacceptable for any respectable establishment to wake their guests up at 1AM outside of genuine safety issues. Following this I was not able to get any sleep due to the snoring of other guests, which would shake the very weak bed frames. The impossibility of sleeping and other guests being sick resulted in me falling quite ill during my stay, making my experience even worse.\n\nOther issues I have encountered:\n- the bed frames are extremely weak. Mine was held together with duct tape. They make a lot of noise when either person in the bunk moves (and as mentioned, snoring from other guests also causes them to shake). This makes it extremely difficult to get any sleep.\n- the stairwell does not feel safe. The railing is shaky when weight is put on it.\n- daily ‘cleaning’ is extremely cursory. They typically don’t spend more than 5 minutes cleaning a room (including the bathroom). The bathroom smells quite bad.\n- the place is littered with signs denying any liability for stolen luggage, despite very little effort to provide security. There is a luggage room at the ground floor that is always open so it is very easy for someone to just steal luggage from. I feel much safer leaving my luggage under my bed, but even then there was a worry every time I left the hostel. It genuinely feels like this place cares more about avoiding liability for stolen luggage than it does with providing a half-decent experience for its guests which is… disappointing, to put it mildly.\n\nNote: while I made the mistake of booking this hostel for an extended period of time, all of the issues I’ve described occurred within the first 3 days of my stay, with most of them being on the first. Save yourself the headache and stay anywhere but here.', 'Enjoy hostel is located in a quiet arrondissment.

Theres a kitchen but almost just like a cafeteria style with the most basic amneties (electric kettle, sink, fridge, microwave) I thought I that there is free breakfast but there werent when I was there so that was disappointing :/\n\nFor the rooms: I booked a 8-dorm all female. The room is divided into two different rooms with each four beds and bathroom in each. There are no curtains and the blanket is not thick.

The service, however, was terrible. Staff at reception were always talking on the phone, not willing to communicate with guests.

No one recovered anything.\n\nI also got a terrible rash in different parts of my body after sleeping there for 1 night so I also doubt their cleanliness.\n\nThe building is old and has no elevator, so keep that in mind.

Self-awarded? Slightly grubby and worn, with centralised heating that makes the hotel feel like a sauna at times and freezing at others with barely any opening windows (meaning the rooms have condensation on the window sills, which isn’t great for an asthmatic). Over-crowded to try to satisfy the “amenities”, leaving rooms feeling cramped and stifling - you can’t squeeze in a desk if it means you can’t actually pull the chair out because there’s no space between it and bed! Neither can you offer a bath if the plugs don’t work & the toiletries are empty! And don’t put heating and air controllers in the room if you’re actually controlling everything at reception and the guest has no autonomy over whether they want the heat on or not. Finally got what I was told was the only room in hotel with opening windows and my wife bent down to pick something up and caught her back on the edge of the open window frame, tearing her shirt and giving her a 4cm cut on her back. That could have been devastating for a child, but the manager was entirely disinterested. Hope their parent company takes the danger more seriously. As others have said the staff are in general unable or unwilling to find solutions, requesting you “give them time” to sort things out but then not doing anything until it’s too late, and worse, lying about what was actually said to them and when. Should have moved out after the first horrible night but when only away for 3 nights it’s such a lot of effort to find another hotel for the next 2, and foolishly believed the management would try to find a fair solution. Accor need to value their customers as there are a lot of competitors out there and this lazy attitude towards providing a good service doesn’t make them a contender. Have stayed in a couple of decent Mercures but after this experience would absolutely would not recommend, and if this is the attitude they’re told to adopt, wouldn’t bother staying in an Accor hotel again at all. Spoiled our weekend without a care in the world, wasted so much of our time, and made it all worse by their inconsistency in keeping to the facts.

However, unlike other Marriott locations, this hotel informed me that they could not offer the morning breakfast benefit due to the discounted booking. At other Marriott properties, I’ve always been welcomed with a note, cookies, or pastries, regardless of the rate, so this was quite unexpected.\n\nHousekeeping was another major issue. On the first day, my room was not cleaned at all. I reached out multiple times to request service, and while I was assured someone would attend to it, the room was never made. For the remainder of my stay, I had to remind the staff every morning before leaving the hotel to ensure housekeeping was done.\n\nAs a loyal Gold Elite member, I have always trusted Marriott to deliver a high standard of hospitality, but this stay fell short in several ways.

The most disappointing part is that the hotel completely ignored my follow-up requests after I checked out. Once they have your money, then you will be treated as no one. The conference organizer also mentioned that I wasn’t the only one—others experienced similar delivery issues.\n\nAdditionally, during my stay, my room was not properly cleaned, even when I specifically requested it. The housekeeping service was limited and unresponsive.

We were told this was a “general issue” throughout the entire hotel and that it would be fixed the next morning. Three days later, it was still not fixed and we resorted to leaving the door of our room open while we were there because the hallway was cooler than our room. That’s when we decided to leave.\n-The shower did not work properly, regardless of what temperature it was set to it would oscillate between very cold and so hot I was worried I would burn myself. I spoke with others at the hotel and they had the same problem.\n-Many other small issues that spoke to the hotel reopening being rushed (we were told the hotel had only recently reopened after some years). Placards posted upside down, holes in walls or poorly repaired and stained walls, our emergency info placard in our room falling off of the door, door handles not being properly secured (the bathroom door handle came off in my hand).\n-The location was not the best if you want to see the sights in Paris, but I don’t blame the hotel for that, it just is what it is. The hotel is very close to two metro stops.\n\nAll of this was just disappointing for what was supposed to be a four star hotel that hosts large gatherings. I suspect that the hotel opening was a bit rushed in the end and they did not pay enough attention to fit and finish, and possibly didn’t stress test the systems like the AC to make sure they worked properly under full load. We were even told by employees that they were essentially totally booked up their opening day because of a conference that stayed there before ours, and that they were massively understaffed (we noticed the cleaning lady still working on cleaning rooms at 5-6pm and later some days).', 'Great hotel with an excellent staff, who were very courteous and accommodating.

We asked for at least a blanket and were rejected again, being told that there is none, and according to 'regulations' we can't have any.

I had not been in well over 10 years. When we arrived we were greeted warmly. The staff there are top notch. In particular Alexia. She always had a smile on her face and was so helpful the entire stay. She gave excellent recommendations and was just extremely professional but was always warm as well. The room was initially a shock for me. It was far smaller than I was expecting. It was nice though. It had a desk that I used as a vanity. The cleaning staff was amazing as well. I loved that they provided a great quality body wash, although I brought my own. It was a very nice touch. The breakfast was a great blend of different foods. As a vegan I did not have many options but my husband did. I am not much of an eater so I was fine with fresh fruit. They have an amazing coffee machine where I would have great coffee with my fruit and toast. The location is wonderful. It is central to so many great places. I did find a vegan restaurant that was close but the food was not that great. I did find a vegan burger place and it had great food. This hotel is perfect for tourists who are going to be out most of the day. It was tight for my husband and I with all of our luggage. We managed fine and I would definitely stay there again. The star of this hotel is the staff. All were amazing. Security is also great. You have to leave your key with the front desk when you are going out. I found it odd initially but was comforted by the security behind it. I would suggest having subtitles on the television but when I did watch shows I managed to figure out what was going on by just watching lol. All in all I love this hotel.

Everyone was very kind, and a special thanks to Paul, who gave us a full explanation of the area as soon as we arrived. He made sure we had everything we needed and was always smiling and helpful. However, regarding the room, it was extremely small. We had a hard time managing with our suitcases because there was hardly any space to put them, so we decided to unpack everything, but even then, there wasn’t much storage space.\n\nWe also had an issue with dust – we kept sneezing, so we asked Paul if they could vacuum thoroughly, which they did, and it helped a little. Still, we ended up buying allergy medicine just to make it more bearable.\n\nAs for the location, it’s absolutely perfect! There’s a metro station just 100 meters from the hotel, which made it really easy to get around during our stay. There are also a few bus stops nearby that were super convenient. Right below the hotel, there are good restaurants, and across the street, there’s a delicious crêpe place. Overall, I highly recommend the hotel for its location – it’s very central and relatively quiet. However, do keep in mind that the rooms are small, even for a couple, so space can be an issue.\n\nWe didn’t try the breakfast because it’s €16 per person, which we felt was a bit pricey since we preferred to grab a croissant and coffee from different places each morning, and we don’t regret that decision at all.\n\nThank you so much for the lovely stay, and a big thank you to Paul for all his help!', 'Great and quiet location, 24h reception.

One notable improvement was that the cleaning staff was much quieter in the mornings, which made it easier for me to work.\n\nHowever, there were additional issues. We were overcharged for the city tax, and during checkout, I was unexpectedly told there was a breakfast charge. This was surprising since I never visited the breakfast area. I refused to pay for this breakfast charge as it clearly was assigned by mistake, and the hotel assured me that they issued a reimbursement for the overcharged city tax.\n\nI was asked multiple times about my negative review, but unfortunately, my overall experience remains unchanged.

In fact, you can even see light from the corridor through the gap between the door and the frame.\n\nTo make matters worse, the room had a bad odor, and the cleaning staff was incredibly loud throughout the day, which was disruptive if you wanted to work or sleep in. The staff at the hotel is kind but clearly inexperienced, and I never encountered a manager during my stay.\n\nWhile the location is convenient, the overall quality of the hotel is far below expectations, and it’s definitely overpriced for what you get.

Residhome Paris Gare de Lyon - Jacqueline de Romilly,"47 Rue Jorge Semprún, 75012 Paris, France",48.8420678,2.3840669,500,4.2,"['Stayed here for one night in August 2024. Great location if you need to be close to Gare de Lyon as it is walking distance. It’s really a good hotel considering the star rating and the location. Everything was very clean and the lady on the reception desk was absolutely lovely. She even changed the room when she realised I was travelling with my brother and not my husband (always happens as we obviously have the same surname) so that we could have two beds, rather than one.\n\nWould recommend this hotel.', ""I stayed for two nights and really liked my apartment. It had everything you need for a pleasant stay. The selection of coffee, tea and water in the room is also nice. Communication with staff was excellent: everybody spoke English very well.\n\nThe only disappointment was the small selection at breakfast. Although all food offered was of very high quality, they could make sure that they don't run out of baguette 20min after breakfast starts, and pretty much every limited option line yoghurt and bread selection one hour before the breakfast time ends. Also there is limited amount of cutlery and plates available. Asking the staff for a single further spoon is a bit annoying. So altogether: good food but not nearly enough of it."", ""Rude staff. Unsanitary and dirty. There's no usual housekeeping (they ask you +10 Euros for basic housekeeping) and they won't even change your towels (even if you demand while staying for six night)."", 'Clean and great customer service. When I went to check in, the girl at the counter was assisting two other customers. She was efficient while still making sure guests had all the information they needed to enjoy their stay. The hotel provides free luggage storage before and after your stay. The suite also comes with a small kitchen with fridge, stove, kettle, plates, utensils, pots and pans. There is also a dishwasher which I thought was a nice touch. The bathroom was clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable. Lots of plugs around the room for you to charge your devices. About a 15min walk from Gare de Lyon. I would stay here again.', ""I know Paris is Wonderfull and we had a perfect and amazing time in the city, but having some Netflix capable tv would have been nice at the end of the day, minor but worth mentioning its not available if you like it. I had a great stay here, however I was charged for extra city tax at the check-out. I was told someone did a mistake at the checking, but I payed the price I got on the internet and on the email, so this was 100% a surprise and probably ilegal (in most countries it is), since it diverge from the price I have on my email as well. I believe some kind of rule changed in the meantime (as the staff justified), but I should have been told this before and asked if I agree with the new price. They let it to the last second (after 6 nights) when we were rushing to the airport to explain and charge me for this. It's not about the amount, it's about being charged for something I was never told, didn't agree and was only informed at the absolute last second when leaving the place delaying even more what should have been fast. The experience overall was great, just the checkout and lack of communication gave me a bad impression that will stick... I asked for an email reply just explaining why the error occurred (not what the new tax is/was), but haven't received it. That's the minimum to do to someone you are demanding more money that was never agreed. Although small this things can make you uncomfortable. It's hard to have empathy when I have to pay (not an option) for someone else's mistake (btw also on my confirmation email) and they don't event take the time to send an clarifying email after I ask for it. If it wasn't for this, I'd definitely recommend  the place with 4 starts as everything else was simple but smooth, and the staff was nice when needed.""]",12e

Secondly, the rooms themselves work fine but for a 4 star location, it does not come even close to that standard. Lots of chips on doors, some things were dirty.

One day we did not even have a toll and had to go to the reception to get one.', '**Dear Hotel Team,**\n\nI recently stayed at your hotel and would like to share some feedback that might help enhance the experience for future guests.\n\n1. **Room Size:** The first room I was assigned (Room 633) was surprisingly small, to the point where I had to open my suitcase on the bed due to the lack of space. This was quite unexpected, as I have not encountered such limited space in a hotel before.\n\n2. **Noise and AC Issues:** The first room also had constant noise from the elevator, which sounded like fireworks and continued until midnight, making it difficult to relax. This noise resumed early in the morning as well. Additionally, the airflow from the AC unit was directly hitting my head while I tried to sleep, which was uncomfortable and forced me to turn the AC off. In the second room (Room 530), I slept well on the first night. However, on the second night, a neighboring couple argued loudly until 1 AM and then resumed at 4 AM. I couldn\'t contact reception because there was no phone in the room, and when I tried calling the hotel from my mobile, there was no answer. I had to ask the couple to quiet down myself.\n\n3. **Room Amenities:** I was surprised to find that there was no phone in the room, making it difficult to get assistance when needed. Additionally, I noticed the absence of a smoke detector, which raises safety concerns.\n\n4. **Breakfast:** The breakfast offering did not include any fruit, despite the website stating otherwise. Adding fresh fruit to the breakfast menu would greatly enhance the experience, especially since there’s a grocery store nearby.\n\n5. **Cleanliness:** The towels in the second room appeared ""brownish,"" giving them an old and less-than-clean appearance. Providing white towels would create a more reassuring and clean feeling for guests.\n\n6. **Shower Experience:** Operating the shower was quite challenging. It took me some time to figure out how to adjust the water temperature, and when I accidentally turned the pipe the wrong way, I was doused with cold water. Clearer instructions or more intuitive controls would help avoid such surprises, especially during the winter months.\n\n7. **Garage:** The garage was extremely narrow. If I had brought a larger car, I wouldn’t have been able to drive up to the roof where parking is located.\n\nFor a total cost of €600 (4 days), I found the overall service to be questionable.

Its serene location offers a peaceful retreat from the city's hustle and bustle, making it an ideal spot for relaxation. Each morning, guests can indulge in a delightful little breakfast featuring freshly baked croissants, which are a staple of French cuisine. The warm, flaky pastries paired with a cup of rich coffee create a perfect start to the day.\n\nOf course! Refilling the soap in the rooms is essential to maintain hygiene and ensure a pleasant experience for everyone. It's a small task that can make a big difference in guest satisfaction and comfort. Regularly checking and replenishing soap supplies also contributes to a cleaner environment and shows attention to detail in hospitality services. Remember to check each room's dispensers or soap holders and replace or refill them as needed. This simple yet significant action helps in upholding high standards of cleanliness and care.\n\nThere is an elevator but you will have to carry your suitcase because it lands in between floors."", 'On 22 July, 2024, my wife and I checked in here at around 11pm.

Their attentiveness genuinely made my stay more enjoyable.\n\nBreakfast was a mixed experience. The sweet options were fantastic, offering a great start to the day. However, the savory choices were a bit limited, with just scrambled eggs, sausages, ham, and salami. On the bright side, the cheese selection was quite good, which added some variety.\n\nOne thing I really appreciated was the cleanliness of the room. It was spotless every day, and having a fridge in the room was a great bonus for keeping drinks cool or storing snacks.\n\nThe hotel is located a bit outside the main tourist areas, which I found to be a plus since it provided a quieter, more relaxed atmosphere. It’s perfect if you’re looking to escape the hustle and bustle.\n\nIn summary, while the room size and lack of a bidet were slight drawbacks for me, the friendly staff, cleanliness, and peaceful location more than made up for it. I’d definitely consider staying here again, especially if I’m looking for a quieter place to unwind.', 'The staff at this hotel were incredibly welcoming and helpful throughout our stay.

A great stay from the slightly rocky start to a wonderful and relaxed finish."", 'A weekend well spent at Molitor! The interior and exterior pools are truly the highlight of the vacation! The hotel is beautifully nestled within the city borders of Paris with very kind and helpful staff always ready to assist you in whatever you need. The continental breakfast was a 10/10, there’s everything you need and more for a filling morning meal! The rooms were clean however a couple hairs were found in our bathrobes and in the bathroom (hoping this is a one off thing). A perfect weekend getaway within city limits.', 'My family stayed at Molitor Hotel back in July for 5 days and I have to say it was one of the nicest hotels and experiences that we’ve had. The customer service was top notch. We arrived early and they took care of us as we few in on a red eye and were all exhausted from the flight. Once our room was ready we walked in and it was decorated with balloons and confetti and a poster cheering on my son and wishing him luck on his tournament we were attending in Slovenia. Our experience was nothing short of amazing. We were comfortable in our rooms and the gym was great. We loved waking up every morning to go work out and sauna then head to the dining area for breakfast. The kids loved the outdoor pool.\nWe will be back 100%. Favorite hotel. 10/10', 'The coup de grace is however the swimming pools and spa. I’m an avid swimmer and the pools were among the best ever. Heated to a lovely temperature and beautifully restored.  I would stay again at the drop of a heartbeat.  Staff is very hospitable and the breakfasts are real treat.', 'Molitor is a nice hotel with a lot to offer, though it’s located a bit outside the city center. The breakfast was amazing, and the room was comfortable. Unfortunately, we didn’t get to enjoy the pool as we had hoped.\n\nOn the downside, compared to other hotels we’ve stayed at in Europe, the service wasn’t as accommodating. My wife’s hair iron stopped working, and while another hotel was able to provide a replacement when we had a similar issue, this hotel didn’t seem to care. It’s those small details that can make a big difference in guest experience. Overall, a nice stay, but the level of service could be improved.']",16e

This delightful boutique hotel did not disappoint.  Everything was done to put the comfort of the client first.  The historic house reflects the owner’s attention to detail, from decoration to a well-planned book of information in each room, comfortable bedding and a great continental breakfast.  This is in a quiet, off the main track area of Paris and is a very desirable place to be.  No crushing sidewalk crowds. There’s a small Auchon grocery steps away along the street. Wonderful restaurants are only blocks away and you’re centered two or three blocks from two metro stops.  We felt safe walking in the area and particularly enjoyed shops, cafés etc. along Av. Mozart and in the upscale Auteuil neighborhood.\nOur room was quiet, bright and cheerful with a large window overlooking the garden terrace (rain prevented us from enjoying the courtyard) and a large comfortable bed. The bathroom was spacious with 2 sinks, large tub and great walk-in shower.\nThe petit déjeuner was well presented on a finely set table, generous wIth croissants, cake, baguettes, yogurt, butter, jams, cheeses and more. The coffee was made to our specific desire and was delicious.\nOwner and host, Christophe is charming and friendly, ready with many local restaurant recommendations and helpful with getting around Paris (making reservations) and especially knowledgeable regarding airport access.\nWe hope to visit Christophe and Villa du Square again.  Three days was not enough to do the area justice.', 'The place is located in a very nice neighborhood, calm and quiet. The interior is furnished stylishly, comfortably and tastefully.

During my stay there was no internet, which was problematic for me because I was on a business trip.', ""The host could not have been more accommodating or gracious. He called for a  car service to the airport for me because my French was not good enough.

After traveling for 24 hours, I arrived at 11:30 PM with two XXL suitcases and four additional bags. When I requested help with my luggage, a Nepali staff member reluctantly assisted but remarked to the receptionist, “She has her husband with her; why can’t he carry the luggage?” To my shock, the receptionist, a Black man, began shouting at me, saying, “Tell your husband to show some muscularity. Why can’t he pick up the luggage?”\n\nFor close to 15 minutes, he continued shouting at me, saying things that were completely unprofessional and inappropriate. Instead of offering basic hospitality, such as water after a long journey, he displayed anger and disrespect. His behavior was shocking and far from the standards expected from a Novotel hotel.\n\nI chose not to file a formal complaint as I was staying only for one night, but I did report the incident to staff members Stephane and Jean. Whether any action was taken remains unclear. Adding to the disappointment, the hotel charges guests for luggage transport between the room and reception. I had to pay for this service the following day, something I’ve never experienced at any other hotel.\n\nThis was a deeply disappointing experience.

The water available is not complimentary—each bottle costs 8€, and it’s refilled, meaning it’s not even a new bottle. 😂\n\nTo make matters worse, the cleaning staff attempted to enter the room at any time without knocking or asking for permission. I had to lock the door with the latch to ensure no one could walk in unexpectedly! Moreover, it was extremely difficult to get a response when calling the front desk. When they did answer, they would direct me to another extension, which would in turn transfer me to yet another extension, and so on.\n\nFinally, during check-out, a staff member asked for a tip. When we told him we don’t have cash on hand, he rudely demanded 12€ as a fee for carrying the bags downstairs. When we politely questioned the basis of this charge, he pulled out a printed sheet to show us. After objecting to his rude behavior, he started pushing the bags toward us and said, “Carry them outside by yourselves!”\n\nI do not recommend staying here.

My husband and I spent 3 nights and loved every minute. Our room was small, which is typical of rooms in Europe, and was fine with us. It was clean, the bed was comfortable and the shower was hot. That's all we need! I also loved that we could tuck our smaller suitcases under the bed. The best part of the hotel was the staff though. Seriously some of the friendliest people I've ever met. They really understand the meaning of customer service. Jean-Claude was so welcoming, and hilarious! He was always upbeat and happy and kept us laughing. Wilfred is a bartender extraordinaire! I had way too many of his special Pink October drinks because they were delicious! And it was for a good cause - part of the proceeds are donated to breast cancer research. Beyond that, he is just a kind, sweet man. The owner (whose name has slipped my mind - I'm so sorry!) was there every night and made us feel so welcome and appreciated. We absolutely loved just hanging out with all of them. The woman who was in charge of breakfast (another name I have unfortunately forgotten) was so sweet and friendly too. Loved the bar/reception area. Very cozy and comfortable. The fact that the hotel is just a few minutes' walk from the Eiffel Tower, and right across the street from the Metro station was icing on the cake. If we ever get back to Paris, we will absolutely stay here again!"", 'This hotel exceeded all expectations! The service was exceptional, with friendly and attentive staff who truly went above and beyond and gave great conversations. A special mention goes to the hotel manager—Lilly, the resident cat—whose sweet demeanor and calming presence made our stay even more delightful. She adds a touch of charm while ensuring the hotel feels secure and welcoming.\n\nCleanliness is clearly a priority here, as the housekeeping team works tirelessly to maintain spotless rooms and common areas. While the rooms are compact, as is typical for European hotels, they are thoughtfully designed and perfect for those planning to spend most of their time exploring Paris.\n\nThe location is unbeatable! Just steps from the Eiffel Tower, the hotel offers easy access to Paris’s top attractions. The Metro station is conveniently across the street, and nearby you’ll find a grocery store, pharmacy, and an array of restaurants. There’s also a dedicated taxi lane right outside, making arrivals and departures stress-free, especially when ordering Ubers or taxis.\n\nI’m already looking forward to staying here again on my next trip!', 'Wonderful stay at Hotel Eiffel Seine for 3 nights. Jean Claude was the best he helped us so very much with food recommendations and setting up things for us. Everyone was friendly and helpful breakfast good and food attendants were very nice as well. Room were nice small as all European rooms but very quaint and good. Best part of hotel was one block from Eiffel tower definitely when we do come back will stay  again']",15e

From the moment I arrived, the service was subpar and the staff were consistently unfriendly and unhelpful.\n\nOne of the first issues I encountered was with the parking. Despite my reservation clearly stating that parking was included, I was charged an additional fee upon arrival. When I brought this up with the front desk, they were dismissive and offered no solution.\n\nThe room itself was another disappointment. It was nowhere near the standard expected of a 5-star hotel. The furnishings were outdated, the amenities were lacking, and the overall cleanliness was questionable. It felt more like a budget motel than a luxury hotel.\n\nConsidering the high price I paid, I expected a much better experience. Unfortunately, this hotel did not deliver on any front. I would not recommend staying here if you are looking for a true 5-star experience. Save your money and look elsewhere.', 'Dodgy.\nThis hotel is not 5 star by any standards more like 3, but the worst is that upon check in staff tried to photocopy my credit card and CCV number despite having already used the credit card machine to secure a deposit. I refused for my credit card details to be copied in this way and cancelled the stay. They did not offer any satisfactory explanation as to why my credit card details were required copied including my CCV number.  It’s absolutely normal to photocopy passports and take a security deposit on the machine but why photocopy my credit card including the CCV? At best this is very unprofessional & negligent, and at worse, potentially fraudulent. My recommendation is to avoid.', 'The hotel is not meeting 5star standard, the room was smelling cigarettes (curtains), and seemed dirty, the bathroom was old and bathtub dysfunctional with difficulty to achieve desired water temperature. Air conditioning was not working properly and air in the room was stuffy. Breakfast was not tasty at all, croissants seem old and defrosted which in France in hotel that claims 5star I find it unacceptable. The staff was helpful, and location convenient having come for Rolland Garros. Overall, a disappointing experience, not worth the money and certainly not meeting 5star standard.', 'Great and spacious room- super comfortable- welcoming team. Will definitely recommand', 'Been meaning to write this review as I rarely do, but extreme times call for extreme measures.  This hotel doesn\'t deserve to be called 5-star, I honestly think someone paid someone off to get that rating...\n\nHad 2 rooms for a family trip because of aforementioned 5-star rating and the area to things we wanted to visit.   The location is probably the only decent thing about the place and maybe the restaurant inside.\n\nDecor is very dated and dark.  I\'m not dinging the place for that because it\'s a very intentional style choice, but just be aware.\n\nBathroom sink has a strange design where the water pools in the corner of the sink and doesn\'t drain.\n\nThe biggest problem is that the rooms are FILTHY.  Room had had carpets that were filled with stains.  Pillow cases and sheets had small dark stains.  But the absolute worst thing is that the ""fresh"" towels/robe had this massive brown stain that looked like dried blood or something.  One of my family members also tried to hang their pants on one of the hangers and some chemical (?) on the hanger transferred to the pants and absolutely ruined them.\n\nI was livid, but since this was booked by a family member I had to temper my complaints to management.  I have never experienced this in any hotel in any city, let alone one that claims itself ""5 star"".\n\nFor reference, we stayed at Maison-Albar and Park Hyatt Vendome in the same stay and they were light years ahead.

You can walk to the grounds in 40 minutes and the hotel is accessible to metro and the rest of Paris. I’m a big fan of this area.\n\nI had high hopes for this hotel but was sadly disappointed. First, let’s talk about the size of the room (see the picture). It’s perfectly fine for a single traveler but I cannot imagine sharing this room. There would literally be no way to walk around the room if you have luggage. And also notice the glass door to the bathroom. Unless you and your traveling companion are so intimate that you need no privacy you’re ok, but if this makes you as squeamish as me, look elsewhere.\n\nThe hotel is very very crowded all of the time. There were massive crowds in the lobby at all hours. Waiting for an elevator at any time took at least five minutes. I didn’t mind hiking up five levels using stairs but you may not want to do this.\n\nThe hotel encouraged guests not to use housekeeping and even gave you a little sign to put on the door saying that a tree would be planted for each time you declined the service. Lovely idea, but may I suggest an upgrade on the towels. They are so thin that they are not even fit for a hostel, which required more housekeeping than I would normally request so I didn’t have to use a wet towel.\n\nThe housekeeping is not great either. The toilet broke during my stay. I went downstairs late at night to tell the front desk, but nobody was there to help. I just had to go down to the basement each time I wanted to use the bathroom which is was easier than getting the attention of the front desk. Housekeeping didn’t fix the issue either. Housekeeping also didn’t refill the soap and shampoo bottles in the room. After proceeding to the front desk late at night to ask for more shampoo and body wash (and again not getting any help) I went across the street to monoprix to buy my own.\n\nA few more tidbits:\n\n- The one piece of exercise equipment in the very small gym (a treadmill) didn’t work. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel if you want a working gym.\n\n- My key card stopped working twice during my visit (necessitating more visits to the front desk to get it fixed).\n\n- After six nights at this hotel, the night manager stopped me as I came back my final night, grilling me about the details of my reservation. Although I appreciate the extra security measures, perhaps focusing on defective toilets, broken key cards, and lack of cleaning supplies in the rooms would be a better use of time 🤷\u200d♂️\n\nAnyway, this place was certainly interesting but for the same price I recommend the Novotel or Mercure in the same area.', 'Very cute hotel in the center of Paris.

However, when I checked on Google, it showed that the parking was actually 10 minutes away. She insisted that Google was wrong and promised to show me a shortcut upon my arrival, as some members of our party have knee problems and a 10-minute walk for them is challenging.

On top of all this, one of the breakfast lady was incredibly rude, told us we have to sit at a 2 person table when we were clearly 3 people. She went to complain about us in front of us to the front desk, all because she did not want to clean a bigger table. Forget offering a high chair, what did she expect we would leave our baby on the floor?

Couldn’t fault the Eiffel Tower view (we paid extra for it) but it was a great location, near metro stations (walking distance max 10 minutes), had a bus stop outside the hotel it was very handy.\nHowever, that was about the only good thing from the hotel. The reception staff were very rude and blunt, may just be the French but especially so, I had paid extra for early check in, which I was told upon arrival at the hotel that it wasn’t something they could accomodate (so why make that an option to pay extra for??). They tried to not refund the additional money spent on this early check in fee, to which I had to ask numerous times on numerous occasions to finally speak to the manager and have this refunded. Due to the room not being available early as I had paid for, they then charged me an additional €10 to put my baggage in a locker room as they ‘did not have anywhere to store luggage’ which seems ridiculous. Furthermore there was no area available that I could go too to change (as mentioned prior I expected to check in early so none of this would have been needed however it then was) and the only place I was allowed to go due to the fact I hadn’t checked in, was a small toilet, that smelt. Our hotel room was very small but due to only being two of us it was fine, however it smelt of damp and slight mould, and due to being such a high room on floor 28 there was no way we could open any windows (I understand safety risk however not even a small window could be opened even partially to get some actual fresh air in). Our air con didn’t work very well, and nor did it actually heat the apartment when we turned the thermostat up due to going to Paris in January and it being extremely cold outside. Whilst you may have a bath in your room, you cannot actually take a bath unless you ask reception for a bath plug to be delivered due to a bath plug supposedly being a safety issue??? Not quite sure how but anyways. We then requested one to be told we couldn’t have one until the following day as maintenance men had left the building (it was 3pm on a Saturday), and when we asked the following day at midday for one, it wasn’t delivered to our room until 6:30pm the same day.\nThe breakfast is definitely not worth paying for whatsoever, there was a small handful of dried pastries, bread, rolls, yoghurt and fruit and a small hot tub of the most burnt bacon I’ve ever seen, and the wettest, sloppiest scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.

However, while the location is a definite highlight, the experience is somewhat diminished by the limitations of the accommodation itself.\n\nThe rooms are clean and well-maintained, which is always appreciated, but they are exceptionally small. Space is limited to the extent that it may feel cramped, particularly for those with larger luggage or who value a more spacious setting. If you’re assigned a room near the tilted roof, be aware that the slanted ceiling can make even basic activities like taking a shower challenging—you may have to crouch or squat to use the facilities comfortably.\n\nThe elevator is also very small, barely accommodating one or two people at a time, which can be inconvenient, especially during peak times when multiple guests are coming and going. While these aspects may not bother solo travellers or those who don’t mind compact spaces, they could be frustrating for others.\n\nOn the positive side, the staff is friendly and efficient, and the hotel delivers on cleanliness and location.

A short stroll takes one to the Seine, while the nearby metro station opens a gateway to the city's further delights.\n\nIn essence, Hôtel Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel is more than just a place to stay; it is a delightful immersion into the elegance and charm that defines Paris.

Similarly, the room service was prompt and efficient, adding to the comfort of the stay.\n\nThe rooms, while clean and well-maintained, were a bit on the smaller side. However, the hotel's fantastic location more than made up for it, with easy access to the eiffel tower and public transportation.\n\nOne slight inconvenience was during checkout when there was no one available to assist with picking up the luggage, which caused a bit of a delay. That said, this was a minor hiccup in an otherwise good stay.\n\nIf you're looking for a hotel with excellent service and a prime location, Pullman Paris is a solid choice!"", ""This hotel exceeded my expectations so my advice to others is to ignore the negative reviews as your experience could be different from others. We arrived in Paris early and we had to stow our luggage somewhere so we took a cab and went there straight from Gare du Nord. As we got there at 12PM we were more than exalted to be told that our room was ready. We had some good rest in the room before going out to explore Paris. The room layout is superb and we loved it. It wasn't enormous which goes to show that layout matters over sheer size. The view was fantastic even from the room on the left side of the building. I did request by email in advance for a room on the right side of the building and apparently it was not entertained but i had no regrets or complaint. The early check-in was more than advantageous to us. The balcony is a great feature as we all had a good time outside gazing at La tour Eiffel, watching people play in the stadium and and the bustling streets below. The room was very nicely appointed, tasteful decor i must say. The breakfast spread was good, i enjoyed the fluffy croissant and self-pressed orange juice. The staffs were all very friendly, accommodating, and would make a fuss of my toddler.  It was a great choice of hotel."", 'Outhman offered exceptional service and was lovely to have such a friendly person greet us and welcome us into the hotel. The rooms are very average, and you can easily hear the guests in the rooms on either side. We paid extra for a high floor and the views were spectacular.

We ate our breakfast, I rummaged through my bag (which no one noticed) and then checked again with the clerk to make sure our bags would be stored and she confirmed they would be put in the storage room. 4.5 hours later we returned and our bags were still against the wall next to the elevator, Louise (front desk clerk, and not who tagged our bags) was in a argument with a guest, we grabbed our bags and left and he didn't even notice us. Anyone could have walked off with our bags at any time during that time or taken our bags up the elevator, taken anything they wanted out and returned them without anyone knowing. We should have insisted someone put our bags away before we left for the morning, but we were assured it would have been done. This put a damper on our stay"", 'Very nice hotel and rooms.

Our flight was late and we were waiting, unsure if the driver was there, but he did come. Lovely BMW and drove us over the bridge and opened the glass roof for us to see the tower for the first time. It was worth the cost. Our return transfer was in a Tesla and he took us via Arc de Triomphe playing a romantic music playlist, he charged €175 on Sat early am.\nOn our arrival, hotel staff welcomed us and took copies of our passports so staff could identify guests to give a personal service.

I’m convinced the cleaner spent the duration of our stay in the cupboard as the doors were not stop being opened and shut. This lead to us not getting very good sleep during our stay. The bathroom also had a plug socket hanging out and the mirror was very dirty, as if it had paint on it.

The location is excellent, very walkable to the Eiffel Tower, and a few small businesses located around the hotel for convenience. With our room on the 5th floor in the back of the building we could see the top of the Eiffel Tower. Room service was always good and very quick.\n\nCons:\nThe room itself was nice except for the water damage in one corner. There was what appeared to be some black mold near rhetorical ceiling, and the wallpaper was peeling off, presumably because of water entering. The heating was a bit annoying to work, since the radiators took a while to change the room temperature. The room also lacks a mini fridge, but since I was there in winter I was able to put my drinks on the balcony to keep them cold. Walls are also a bit thin, and we often heard the neighboring rooms talking.']",15e

The picture you see online looks 100% better than the actual room you get so be warned!\n\nAs if the room wasn’t bad enough, the service was worse! We were greeted by the most unwelcoming lady at the front desk, who scoffed at my reservation due to me using my preferred name instead of my legal name, which has never been a problem at any other hotel since I have the booking confirmation to show via email. When we were finished checking in we received 0 instructions on how to get to our room, no directions to the elevators or anything. The family that came before us spoke French, and it seemed like we received different treatment since we are English speaking, or perhaps because of my race.\n\nAll in all no matter how much of a deal you get at this hotel- ask yourself, is it really worth the terrible service that will ruin your vacation mood, and sleeping with an unbearable onion sewage smell in the room?', 'The hotel was lovely and surprisingly quiet.

While the overall experience was average, the hotel fell short of expectations for a 4-star property. Honestly, I’m not sure how it differs from a 3-star hotel.\n\nOne major issue I encountered was with modifying my reservation, which was booked through a third-party website. I realized I had selected the wrong dates and tried to modify the reservation within 10 minutes of making it. The hotel chose to respond five days later, saying they couldn’t accommodate the modification. Even after I provided proof showing I had reached out within minutes of the initial booking, they blamed the third-party website for the issue and claimed it was out of their hands.\n\nDespite contacting the hotel directly two weeks before my stay to resolve the matter, they kept deflecting responsibility and running away from my modification request. This lack of accountability forced me to reserve an additional night at the hotel, paying almost the same amount as my original two-night stay. I did this solely because I was traveling with four large bags and two smaller ones, and staying at one hotel was the most convenient option. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have chosen to stay here again.\n\nAdditionally, there were other disappointing aspects. When I arrived, no one offered to assist me with my luggage, which is not what I expect from a 4-star property. I also asked for a power adapter since I traveled from the U.S., and they told me they didn’t have any. Eventually, they gave me an adapter left behind by a previous guest, which worked but was far from ideal.\n\nLastly, the room cleaning service frequently blocked half the corridor leading to my room, making it inconvenient to walk through. While I understand that space is limited, it’s still worth noting as an area for improvement.\n\nIn general, the hotel didn’t meet the expectations of a 4-star property. I would’ve rated it 3 stars, but the financial issue and lack of care for customer satisfaction initially made me leave a 1-star review. It doesn’t matter how great your facilities are if you don’t prioritize your guests’ needs. Customer care should always be the top priority in the hospitality industry, and unfortunately, that wasn’t the case here.', 'I loved my stay at this hotel!

The hotel is perfectly situated across the road from a tram stop (and bus stops so easy to get to)! There are shops and restaurants near by also (we went for dinner at Le Royal Cambronne which is about a one minute walk away & it was so good)! I can’t recommend this hotel enough.

The Eiffel Tower, and other attractions, walking distance from the Hotel. Great experience, except for the stairs to get to your room. Not a biggie if you are fit. Small lift, but antique, so decided to rather walk the stairs. Coffee machine in room. Had zero issues with staff, except for one cleaner lady that came in without announcing herself. She was more surprized that us lol. All and all a great experience, and will definitely be back if I ever visit Paris again. This hotel is GREAT if you are a couple.']",7e

Every morning, we were treated to a wide variety of delicious options, from fresh pastries and fruits to hot dishes and gourmet coffee. It was the perfect way to start our days before heading out to explore the city and catch the Olympic events. Another delightful touch was the free ice cream available near the hotel entrance—such a refreshing treat after a day of sightseeing!\n\nFor those planning to stay here, I would recommend booking directly with the hotel to take advantage of any exclusive offers or upgrades. The location is excellent, with easy access to public transportation, making it convenient to explore all that Paris has to offer.

There was no knock, and a second attempt at entry was made 15 minutes later. I had requested and paid for a late check out, so this intrusion caught me by surprise. When bringing it up to the reception staff upon checkout, a ‘sorry, they’re supposed to knock’ was all that was offered.\n\nThis was a splurge as a treat at the end of my stay in Paris, and I don’t spend this amount of money lightly, so I am left feeling disappointed and my jarring experience brushed off. Because of this, I would not recommend this hotel to others.']",6e

He warmly welcomed us, made us feel truly valued, and enhanced our stay with his kindness and professionalism (he mentioned he is of Moroccan origin).\n\nUnfortunately, our experience tonight was completely the opposite. My brother and I were sitting in the lobby between 23:00-01:00 when we encountered a receptionist who was not only disrespectful but also displayed behavior that we perceived as discriminatory. This man, whom we met for the first time tonight, continually interrupted us, asking in a rude tone whether we “needed something” or “didn’t have a room,” accompanied by unfriendly stares and gestures that made his annoyance with our presence very clear.\n\nHe seemed to suggest, without reason, that we were unwelcome or perhaps suspicious, and muttered “strange” under his breath as he walked away after one of our replies. The impression left on us was deeply troubling, as it seemed driven by prejudice against us due to our appearance or heritage.\n\nTo escalate matters, the receptionist deliberately left the automatic entrance doors propped open, causing the lobby to become uncomfortably cold. His apparent intention was to pressure us to leave the lobby, as he returned to close the doors only after we had gone upstairs to our room. He also refused to switch on the coffee machine, falsely claiming it was broken, further showcasing his unwillingness to provide even basic hospitality.\n\nThis level of treatment stands in stark contrast to the excellent service we experienced from your other staff members and leaves us feeling humiliated and racially targeted.

The lobby is sheek and welcoming, and the staff were very to the point upon check in, which is incredibly welcomed after a long day of travel. The hotel is somewhat challenging to get to/from CDG, and a taxi is 65 euro flat fee, so keep that in mind. I stayed in a different Paris hotel that was less money, equally clean, but a much smaller room, so there are other comparable options with probably marginally better value. I would stay here again definitely, but if I was looking to maximize value I would not! The neighborhood is pretty fancy and less dense than other areas such as around Le Senat, so keep that in mind, but there are great restaurants around the hotel including a Michelin restaurant just downstairs.

The room was clean and perfect. They gave me a champagne on my Birthday and I really appreciated it.  The staff were so friendly and helpful.

Two small areas of concern.  1) We believed we had paid a rate that included breakfast. When I went to check it out in the morning for my wife and I, staff informed my we did not have breakfast included. My wife decided to stay in the room and get ready to leave. I ordered coffee and looked at news for about 30 minutes. At that time, the staff informed me they made a mistake and we did have breakfast included. It was too late for either my wife or I to enjoy it as we had to get to the airport. 2) They have a cat(s).

We are coming back to this hotel next time we visit Paris! A+', ""We just stayed here two weeks ago. I was picking my daughter up from a year of exchange in France and we needed somewhere to store her suitcases while we traveled in Europe. Since we were ending our trip in Paris and staying here a few nights, I inquired about luggage storage, and they kept her bags at no charge. This is a great location with the 4 train right across the street, we were able to easily get to attractions. There was a great bakery right around the corner where we got fresh baguette and croissant. Right next to that was a little store with fresh produce and cheese. There was a small fridge in the room to keep things cold. The room was very clean and comfortable. The air conditioning worked great. I thought I had booked a room with a balcony, but while they were checking us in, I asked and they were about to put us in a room without one. They were able to switch us, which we appreciated. We really enjoyed the balcony, it was very small, but added to the Paris experience. Also the windows were pretty sound proof, and we didn't really hear the noise from the street. Our room had a tub, which I loved, but if you are someone with mobility issues you may want to inquire about a shower. It was tricky to get in and out of because of the glass door. The staff was great, highly recommend.""]",6e

While the room was spacious by Parisian standards, the tiny toilet, uncomfortable shower, and very narrow corridors made our stay less comfortable. Additionally, the breakfast area was quite small, and the staff did not seem particularly welcoming.\n\nThe decoration was distinctly Parisian, which added a charming touch, but the busyness of the room’s design might feel overwhelming for those seeking to relax after a hectic day. However, the best aspects were the excellent location, which was convenient and easily accessible, and the comfortable bed, which ensured a good night’s sleep.', 'I am writing this review a couple of months after my stay here. I keep thinking about how wonderful it was. From the moment my fiancée and I walked in, we were treated so kindly and noticed how beautiful the place is. The receptionist that we saw for most of our stay made sure that we had a great time and knew everything that we needed to know. She also allowed us to keep our bags there until check in time since our flight was so early. The rooms are incredibly comfortable and the aesthetic of them is great. There are drinks, breakfast, and it is in a great location. I can’t think of a way that I would make my experience better. Thank you to the staff ♡', 'We enjoyed a gorgeous stay at this pleasant and very friendly hotel.

Around the clock reception which is helpful and makes you feel safe and accommodated. The staff are incredibly sweet, feels like staying with family.', 'Great Location, But Disappointing Service\n\nI recently stayed at this hotel and booked my room the same day, which was a great deal for the area. The location is fantastic, right in the middle of St. Germain de Pres and the 6th arrondissement, which is my favorite part of Paris. Opening the window to a quintessential Parisian view was delightful, with the added charm of hearing French songs from the street below in the afternoons—like something out of a movie.\n\nHowever, the experience was marred by poor service at the front desk. While most of the staff were polite and professional, the woman at the front desk during our stay was incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. Upon arrival, she explained things in a very impolite manner, repeatedly insisting on knowing our entire schedule, including when we planned to wake up, have breakfast, and leave the room. Despite our reassurances that we would follow the hotel’s timing, she continued to insist on its importance.\n\nOur room was another issue—we received two shampoos but no shower gel. When my girlfriend asked for one, the receptionist initially refused to believe us, questioning our word and insisting that the staff never make such mistakes. Eventually, she sent someone to check, and we were proven right, but the interaction left a bad taste.\n\nThe following morning, I chose to fill out the breakfast order form and bring it directly to the front desk. The same receptionist looked at the form with clear disgust and even showed it to the cleaning lady, laughing together. When I confronted her about it, she criticized how I filled out the form and suggested, “Why don’t you have breakfast in the restaurant so it’s easier?”—which is not something you say to a guest. When our breakfast finally arrived, it was incorrect, and when we called to address the issue, she blamed me for filling out the form “wrong.”\n\nWhen my girlfriend called to inform them that our order was completely wrong, this same person started arguing in an extremely informal manner (like a teenager), insisting that it was my fault because I had filled out the form incorrectly—even though she had asked me to redo it with her! My girlfriend pointed out that regardless, this is not the way to speak to customers, and that the essence of her job is not to argue or pass judgment, let alone blame the guests. In response, the receptionist claimed that there were four people in front of her who could attest that she wasn’t being disrespectful, all while verbally attacking my girlfriend with her rapid speech and lack of professionalism. Where are we now? A playground argument? Shocked by such vulgarity and unprofessionalism, my girlfriend decided to hang up. It was truly a shocking and unpleasant experience for her to feel so attacked in this situation.\n\nThis level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable, especially at a hotel of this caliber. Hotel staff should be courteous and focused on finding solutions in a polite manner. Unfortunately, this was not our experience here.']",6e

He was spot on every time.  The breakfasts were good and the location was perfect.\n\nThe walk to Jardin du Luxembourg was only about 5 minutes and when we were not visiting other sites and attractions, we were spending our time there.  Having grown up in the Washington DC for 40 years, the gardens reminded me of the mall in DC, and for good reason.  Pierre Charles L\'Enfant designed both of these spaces (and others) and I could tell the similarities immediately.\nHence why DC has a ""L\'Enfant Station"" on the Metro.\n\nI\'ll also say that the small bar/restaurant on the corner right next to the hotel, Au Père Louis (Bar à Vins Paris - Saint Germain des Prés Paris 6), was extremely nice, lively and welcoming.  The owner, Chris, and the rest of the staff, were also extremely helpful with anything we needed, and try as we did, we were unable to eat every snail in the restaurant.

This was my wife and my first trip to Paris and with the encouragement of our family and friends, we decided to stay in the 5th Arrondissement (Latin Quarter).  The Grand Hotel Saint Michel has a great location within this district with many walkable destinations (Luxembourg Gardens, Pantheon, Sorbonne, others).  The staff were all pleasant and welcoming upon our arrival.\nWhen I booked our stay, I reserved the “superior” room (vs the standard).  I did this for one reason; the description of the superior room indicated it was larger (10+ SF).  We knew European hotel rooms tended to be on the smaller side, so the extra space was important to us. When we checked in, the staff indicated that we were very fortunate because we were getting one of the few rooms with a balcony.  We didn’t really care about a balcony (truthfully, the balcony wasn’t really big enough to sit and enjoy), we just wanted to check in as it had been a very long travel day.\nAfter the second day I stopped and reviewed the floor plans for the various rooms the hotel had to offer.  It was at this time that I realized that the room we had been put into was actually one of the smaller rooms.  With only one more night in our stay and not wanting the hassle of transferring rooms, I didn’t say anything until our departure.  The front desk staff explained to me that the “balcony rooms” are superior rooms because of the “enhanced” accommodations but they are not as big as the other superior rooms.\nSo, if you are wanting the extra space of a “superior” room, don’t accept a balcony room or you will be disappointed.', ""A great place to stay in Paris!

The hotel is situated in the heart of the Saint Michel area of Paris. The neighborhood is charming. In the morning, there is a peaceful atmosphere, and guests have close access to the Metro and RER lines. In the evening, the neighborhood is bustling with activity. We did not hear any unwelcome street noise in our hotel room. Of course, when we wanted to catch a closer glimpse of the activity, we could simply go out to our balcony.\n\nThe rooms are a bit small but quite adequate and comfortable. The hotel staff are friendly and hospitable. They were very attentive to our needs. They closely monitored the front entry, and we felt safe. On one occasion, the gentleman refreshed our metal water bottles with iced water – even without our asking – so thoughtful. After checkout, it dawned on me that I forgot to grab my simple raincoat (windbreaker) in the closet. I emailed the hotel, and they promptly mailed the raincoat to me in the United States. They went above and beyond my expectations.\n\nWe can’t wait to plan for our next trip to Paris, and we will be staying in the Able Hotel Saint Michel!', ""A great accommodation in a very key area of Paris\n\nI'd like to thank the staff of Albe Hotel for making our stay so great!\n\nThe hotel is cozy and is a few steps away from multiple restaurants and even 2 supermarkets\n\nRooms are cozy and include heaters for the winter. You can even dry your clothes with the  heater in the bathroom!\n\nThe pillows were soft and the towels felt great after a long day of exploring the city\n\nNot only are there tons of restaurants, the hotel is also just a few blocks away from Notre Dame.

Including Sheepy the dog 🤣\n\nI would definitely stay at Albe Hotel if I return to Paris one day"", 'Just returned from a 6 night stay at this hotel. Service was excellent and the staff friendly. We did have to store our luggage (which was a lot) but they did accommodate us on the last day - which was very kind and no issues retrieving our bags. I felt the breakfast everyday was really good and didn’t have any desire to go elsewhere for breakfast which was great. One staff member who was there everyday was so friendly and worked exceptionally hard. I wish I had asked her name (she spoke Italian with a couple one morning so maybe that will help identify her to management because she deserved to be noticed). Everything was very clean and cleaning staff were also very friendly. Room had a safe, plenty of room for storage of bags and items, lots of hangers, etc. At least 3 outlets- one by each side of the bed, and one by the small desk, plenty of good lighting, and noise blocking windows. The shower was large and had an amazing rain shower head (plus removable shower head) with great water temps. As well as a place to put soap, etc. Nice small toiletries also. A mini fridge stocked with snacks and drinks (though I didn’t use them I did buy a few of my own I was able to put in there). Steps from metro Saint Michel and Cite a bit further (which I’d recommend using because it’s less crowded and extensive which could be confusing if you’re not used to the metro). Tons of shops and restaurants and lots of souvenir places nearby. It’s a busy area. Super easy to walk to Notre Dame (now open to the public!), Sainte Chappelle, Saint Severin, Cluny Musee, Shakespeare Books, Musee D’Orsay, Jardin du Luxembourg, and a bit further walk is the Louvre, Pantheon, etc. The only issue with location was that some Uber drivers did not want to actually do a pick up at the hotel (tons of pedestrians on the narrow streets) so when we did Uber we had to walk outside of that area to get picked up (drop off wasn’t as much an issue because they just dropped off on blvd St Michel nearby). But that is not the hotel’s fault at all - just thought I’d mention it in case people want to Uber exclusively. If you can manage the steps and walking- the Metro is your best bet.']",5e

We appreciate being able to control the a/c, as that is most often not the case in many European hotels. Some reviewers noted that the rooms were noisy, but we found them to be very quiet, especially since the windows are triple paned, which really helps to cut down on street noise. Breakfast was amazing, and Anna who works in the breakfast room is so sweet. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because Patricia, the manager was unwilling to help us with our simple request. We had booked and paid for a room that included a full breakfast each day (which was not cheap). We ended up having to change our flight going home and had to leave that morning at 6am, well before breakfast started. Even when we gave ample notice and asked politely if we could be reimbursed for the expensive breakfast we wouldn't be there to eat, Patricia refused to do so.

Unfortunately, my experience fell short of expectations.\n\nUpon arrival, we encountered a step leading into the lobby, making entry difficult. I later learned that a ground floor room for disabled guests was available, but it required contacting the hotel ahead of time to secure it. This option was not made clear on Booking.com, where there was no specific way to request a disabled access room. As a result, my mother, who has limited mobility, faced unnecessary challenges. The lift was too small for her standard push wheelchair, forcing her to leave it in the lobby and walk with assistance to our room, which contradicted the notion of “wheelchair accessibility.” Additionally, accessing the breakfast hall in the basement was also a struggle, as it was unsuitable for wheelchair use.\n\nWhen I raised these issues with the staff, they refused to apologise for the inconvenience and stress caused, which was disappointing.\n\nRegarding breakfast, the continental selection was underwhelming, and the hot water for tea was tepid from the machine, making it difficult to enjoy a proper cup. Furthermore, the service from the staff was not friendly.\n\nI also noticed an unexplained €25 charge on my card after checkout, which turned out to be for the city tax—information that was not made clear upon arrival. I hope other guests are made aware of this charge in advance.\n\nI hope the hotel reviews its accessibility standards and improves both the quality of service and communication for future guests. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this hotel for those requiring true accessibility.', 'What I love about this hotel is first and mostly its location. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris for the first time because if you want to go to most of the touristy spots it can be all within walking distance and its still relatively close to the metro for further spots like Sacre Coeur/Montmarte.

After a long and intensive second day in marvellous Paris, room service was still not done at 5 pm. The hotel bar closes at 8pm, so there is no quiet end to the day in the bar.

The croissants, in particular, were delightful.\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n\nWhile I understand that space is generally limited in Paris, paying €400-500 per night for a 5-star hotel sets certain expectations. The lack of sufficient space around the bed to comfortably walk was disappointing. Although it’s unfair to compare Parisian hotels directly to U.S. standards, better space management should be expected at this price point.\n\nIssues Encountered:\n1.\tTemperature Control: The thermostat frequently malfunctioned, requiring frequent resets to stabilize the room temperature.\n2.\tLighting: The floor lamp had a complicated mechanism, and for five out of six nights, it didn’t work, leaving us without adequate lighting.\n3.\tCorridors and Elevators: Both were exceptionally narrow and small, which felt quite cramped.\n4.\tTourist Tax: A €21/night tourist tax was added, which was not disclosed upfront in the Costco package. While this is not entirely the hotel’s fault, it left a sour taste. I plan to follow up with Costco about this oversight, but it’s worth noting that such charges seem excessive and reflect poorly on Paris as a destination.\n\nOverall Impression:\n\nThis hotel, while advertised as 5-star, felt more like a 3-star experience due to the issues mentioned above. Although the staff and service were exceptional, the space constraints and functional problems detract from the overall value for money. I would not rate it higher than 3/5 stars.', 'This hotel’s rating must be based on glazed foreigners enchanted by their first time in Paris. How does this hotel have a 5 Star rating? The bathrooms are tiny, the carpet on the floors is a cheap builders carpet, there’s no gym, or spa anything, the 24/7 room service is non existent (“we only serve cold plates”) and the list goes on.

At the Residence, which is about 50 meters down a cul-de-sac from the main street, which is perfect since it leaves any street noise behind, you are also within walking distance of Notre Dame, Old Paris, and other interesting sites. The basement breakfast nook was very comfortable and well-stocked with full breakfast choices of salmon, fruit, breads, meats and cheeses, and juices and coffee. There is also a clean, modern, and very inviting steam room in the basement. The staff in all areas went over the top to be friendly and helpful. Our time at Residence Henri IV was, in all ways, a wonderfully pleasant and positive surprise."", 'My husband and I had a fantastic stay here for 5 days.

While the rating criteria may differ from one country or region to another, generally speaking, a 4 star hotel is regarded as a high-quality accommodation that offers an array of amenities and services. The guest rooms ought to be roomy, tastefully decorated, and furnished with premium furniture and appliances. A cozy bed with superior quality bedding is also essential.\n\nThe room was more gloomy than roomy. We decided it was “not hideous” when viewed under dim artificial light, rather than in daylight that is completely unforgiving of the many flaws: old, worn and stained carpet, chipped paint, poorly-fitted electrical, and a cracked sink basin. And then there was the bizarre placement of a mirror INSIDE of the tub/shower… how tacky.\n\nThe hotel is indeed “ideally located” near the Bastille Metro station, but it is also a neighbor to crazy homeless people who talk loudly with each other, if not scream, throughout the night. The view from our window included rubbish strewn for several feet outside of an overflowing dumpster.\n\nThe hotel website also boasts a “clever blend of contemporary comfort and the artistic atmosphere of a vast Gallery area”. The “Art Gallery” is simply a display of a single artist’s rather pedestrian and overpriced paintings. As an accomplished artist and designer visiting a city full of amazing art, I am not impressed.\n\nOn our trip we stayed at all “4 star” hotels in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Munich and Vienna.

This is an abuse given the high prices. We checked online and the same rooms for our 300 euro reservation were now offered at 120 euros. As our reservation was not refundable we could do nothing but endure it. Staff was friendly but they knew we weren’t getting what we paid for. For the third and last night they moved me to a similar room like my friend. That really helped as I could shower normally and also enjoyed sleeping. As the two prior nights resulted in stress and I could not sleep well, I cannot say I was happy with my stay. They were very friendly but I can’t help but feel that I didn’t get what I paid for.', 'On the plus side: -very clean;\n- good location of the hotel.\n\nOn the downside: - no air conditioning;\n- no lift;\n- on each floor there is one room, which looks like a long and narrow corridor, the width of which is about 80cm at the end of which is a bed!\nIf you are of average or larger than average build, it will be VERY cramped. This room is more for one person but is offered by the hotel as a double room.\nWhen booking online, no photos of those rooms are available.', 'The rooms are tiny and very hot, even when the weather is cool. There is no elevator and the stairs are very difficult to climb if you have luggage.\nThey do not allow guests to have visitors to the rooms - even if it’s to come to the room for an hour to have a drink.

We felt safe walking at night. The staff was great and spoke English. We arrived early and they did not have our room ready but that was okay because they held our luggage so we could go explore the area. Our room was a perfect size for 2 people. The beds are on the firmer side. The room of the hotel is old but so is all of Paris and we really liked that about this hotel.', 'I stayed at Villa Baumarchais for six nights.\n\nThe staff was lovely, the location convenient, and the beds comfortable. However, does this hotel deserve a four-star rating? No.\n\nThe carpet was missing in spots, the wallpaper was in poor condition, and my friend’s safe wasn’t working. It was quite pricey compared to the standard four-star experience.\n\nOverall, it felt like a tourist trap. This hotel needs significant updates—everything looks cheap, and the showers are uncomfortable. I requested a king bed but was given two singles pushed together; when I was moved to a different room, it only had a queen bed. Being from the hospitality industry myself, I found this experience disappointing. To make matters worse, I saw the general manager reprimanding staff one morning right in front of me. There was also a leak in the lobby ceiling.\nOh I forgot to mention the beautiful spider web near the lobby.\nI feel sorry for the staff because they were sweet, but it’s unacceptable to pay so much and receive such a poor experience. I won’t be returning.', 'Super hotel fantastic location.  Only negative was there’s a master switch in the bedroom which a lot of hotels have but this one shuts off the electrical sockets at night so my phone didn’t charge all night.  I would have been in trouble if I had been flying the next day with no charge on my phone and access to boarding pass etc.  Copped it for the second night but inconvenient having no phone all day.  Otherwise a super hotel.  Got much better rate booking directly w hotel', 'What a gem!!  We had no idea what to expect upon our arrival but we were pleasantly surprised at its unique beauty. All of the staff we encountered were warm and helpful. They couldn’t be more kind to us Americans!  Our room was as perfect…beds comfortable, quiet hallways and a mini fridge. To have heat, air and an elevator in Paris is a plus!  We will definitely be back!', ""Unfortunately, from the rooms to the hospitality, the Villa Beaumarchais wasn't what we had hoped. The location is good, but I wouldn't recommend this property to friends.\n\nWe spent several nights here while celebrating a milestone anniversary.\n\nUsually - and look I'm not looking for too much here in a romance capital of the world - sharing your trip intentions means a warm welcome - a note, a chocolate, perhaps some sparkling cider - something to welcome an anniversary couple to Paris. They didn't offer a thing. So if you're celebrating something look elsewhere.\n\nSecond, we had noted in our trip booking that we are sober and would like the alcohol removed from the room. It was on the first night, but we were charged as if we had drank it, and we had to have it removed from the bill. The next day, the booze was back in the room. Big miss there, guys. Like BIG miss.\n\nThird, looking for some late night eats, we checked in with the front desk for some recommendations. They said to just walk up on the avenue.\n\nThe staff doesn't have restaurant recommendations? Some take away menus? An offer to call up a restaurant and place an order?\n\nCome on, guys.\n\nFor the good - the bathrooms and bed were clean.\n\nThe rooms themselves though are very dated and dingy.\n\nSome spots on the walls are pitch black from fingerprints.\n\nAdditionally, the amount of furniture in the room makes it claustrophobic and tough to function. There's really no need for a desk, two chairs, and cabinet for the mini fridge.\n\nAnd yet, no drawers for clothing. If you need some space, or have any mobility issues, this isn't the place for you.\n\nBreakfast, which was included, was good, though I found myself just going to the cafe just at the end of the street. The location was very good, too.\n\nSo overall, while the location was good, and the beds and bathroom clean,  the lack of hospitality, and the small, dated rooms will have us looking for a new hotel next time we're in Paris.\n\nTo the business owner's reply: You can get a sense of what they're like here.\n\nA great response would have been taking our suggestions about having a list of late night restaurants, or offering to clear out some furniture from overcrowded rooms. Or, offering to deep clean the century of dirt from the walls of the rooms, or anything to suggest that changes would be made.\n\nIt's just deflection after deflection.\n\nAnd surely, if we were moved rooms we'd be charged more. Check out other people's experiences.\n\nTo be clear: hospitality is about more than friendliness. The front desk folks were friendly enough. It's being able to provide for your guests, and taking actions in response to their feedback.\n\nAnita, you need to significantly step up your game here in terms of actually implementing changes. I'm not the only one -- there's a significant number of experiences similar to mine here. What have you done to improve?\n\nDoesn't seem like much.\n\nHave a good one!""]",3e

They did allow us to store our luggage and had outlet adapters for rent.', ""My boyfriend and I were just at this hotel for five nights, to say that the experience we faced was an unpleasant one is an understatement.\n\nAll of said bad experience mainly stems from the grotesque service that was offered by the receptionists, especially from the woman with a mustache and a very nasty attitude as well as this  man.\n\nOn arrival, since we were early and the room was not ready, we were allowed to leave our luggage with them and return when the room is ready to check in. When we arrived for the second time at the hotel, there were a few guests before us being assisted by the aforementioned lady, so we waited behind them for our turn. When she noticed us, without any greeting or welcome, she ordered us to go sit on the lounge, with no explanation or any niceties from her tone. We did as we were told, and whilst we waited, we realised other people came in and she decided to serve them, so I decided to stand up and see what was happening and remind her that we are still here.\n\nAfter dealing with the other guests, she rudely asked us what we wanted, and I responded with our room. We overlooked the rude greeting thinking it was a one interaction however it did not stop there.\n\nFor some silly reason, we were told that every time we had to leave the building we had to give them our card key to the receptionist and when we return, supposedly, the receptionist that is meant to be at the desk is to return it to us. On one day when we came back to our hotel at 11 pm, there was no receptionist to be found, we checked everywhere, we called out and got no response back. We were panicked that we were going to be locked out of our room. 25 minutes later the receptionist showed up from upstairs relaxed as ever, and gave us our key.\n\nWe were so frustrated with the situation, as we were so tired after a long day at Disney that this was the last thing we wanted to happen, and just wanted to go sleep. So we decided that we will keep the key with us to avoid such a situation. Next day when we headed out, the female receptionist mentioned earlier shouted to us to stop and give her the key, to which we refused and explained to her why. In a patronizing voice she said that it wasn't true there wasn't a receptionist, to which I told her she can look at her cameras.\n\nShe acted in such a disgusting way, I couldn't believe that she was a receptionist in a hotel, as no one should be treated as poorly as we did. She said it was day time and not night time, so we were to give her the card, but she did not understand the fact that we were going to stay out until the night, and we wanted to avoid last night's problem!\n\nShe had spoken to us in such a belittling manner, to that we couldn't take it anymore, as it was getting worse the situation and we just gave her the key. Please note this was on my birthday, and to that it was a horrible way to start.\n\nThat being said, we kept giving them the key during the day but kept it any time we return and go out in the eve, because that is their logic. Except for one time, when this man asked for my name when we asked for the card (for some odd reason), as he  did not make any form of check with the card, and just handed it to me. With that being said, when we were meant to go out at night, we were stopped once again for the card, even though the woman with the mustache told us that we can keep it at night.\n\nIt is a pity that such people have to lower the standards of such a hotel. That being said, on top of the staff being very very poor and have no idea of what it means to work in hospitality, the hotel room was a hole size of a room, with no ac. We were given a fan which we didn't turn on as it was filled with dust and filth. In the hole like bathroom (which is not good for anyone who is 5ft3 upwards) all the pipe work was external and this created a loss of space in said tiny bathroom for movement.\n\nFor anyone who is looking into this hotel to stay here, don't. There is an ibis nearby, with better service and bigger rooms."", 'Rooms are small but clean and comfortable, staff on reception and at breakfast were helpful and friendly.', ""I am usually not one to write negative reviews, but after our recent stay at this hotel in Paris, I feel it is necessary to share our experience.\n\nDespite the appeal of the location, the overall standard of the hotel left much to be desired. The infrastructure of the hotel is, to put it mildly, sub-par. The showers barely trickled water, which made the simple task of showering an unnecessarily complicated and frustrating experience. But these minor inconveniences could have been overlooked, had the service been up to the mark.\n\nHowever, what made our stay truly unpleasant was the discourteous treatment we received from the hotel staff, particularly the receptionists. Both the morning and night receptionists exhibited a shocking level of rudeness and disrespect that I have rarely encountered in my travels.\n\nA particularly distressing incident involved my wife, who isn't fluent in English. When she struggled to communicate our room number to the receptionist, instead of offering assistance or patience, he raised his voice and addressed her in an extremely derogatory manner. This was not just a language barrier issue - it was a glaring example of the lack of basic courtesy and respect that we experienced repeatedly during our stay.\n\nHospitality, by definition, should be warm, welcoming and understanding. It is truly disappointing that this hotel fails to embody these fundamental values. I am an avid traveler and have stayed in various hotels worldwide. Even by average standards, this establishment falls short, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, especially those who value good service and a pleasant experience.\n\nWe travel not just to see new places but to enjoy a comfortable and relaxing stay. Unfortunately, this hotel could not provide that, and the poor treatment we received has tainted our memory of Paris.

If their was one knock I would say is that when I opened the windows there was no bug screens to keep out a new type of guest from my room to share amenities with.  At the same time, the mini fridge was cold, the stove worked and there were plenty of dishes and silverware under the sink.  This facility used to be owned by a local hospital and the staff all said that the one thing that this property never did when they took it over was re-do the shower area to what you might think about in a hotel.

Regarding the cleaning of the room, I believe it is not the client's job to supervise the quality of the work.

About the glass, yes, it is missing, otherwise there would be no holes for screws in the wall, and the water of the shower would not fly out of the enclosure.\n[hotel about the tourist fee]- As regards city taxes, the amount is set by the government and since our aparthotel is not classified and cannot be classified because we do not have the required number of rooms, the amount is 14.95 €/day/person. Within our sales conditions all guests are informed about the city tax.\n[my reply]- As for the tax, if your team\nknows you do not qualify as a hotel, what would be the problem to inform clearly to the client the value of the tax?

We then often went up the road to Place de Nation to sit in the park and eat our breakfast there, from where we could then catch a metro or RER (sort of between a metro and a train) to whatever we had planned for that day.\nOnly on Sunday did we use the hotel\'s breakfast because the boulangerie-patisserie was closed, and it was also the final day of our stay when we needed to check out and be at the Gare du Nord train station in time to catch our Eurostar train.\nThe hotel\'s breakfast buffet was convenient, but in terms of quality nothing compared to our breakfasts on the other days, whilst way more expensive (€14 per adult), so I would highly recommend not paying for the hotel\'s breakfast and instead going to the boulangerie-patisserie and supermarket, or some other place to get a nice breakfast (and eat it in a park or in one of the hotel\'s patio\'s if the place you get your breakfast doesn\'t have seating) unless you need the hotel breakfast for convenience (such as on a travel day).\n\nClose to the hotel there are several metro stations, an RER station, and bus stops, so it\'s very easy to get around by public transport from the hotel.\nThe street the hotel was on wasn\'t particularly nice looking, but there were some nice places nearby.', 'I have not stayed at Bastille Patio hotel but the event agency I work with had/has crew staying at the hotel for part of the Paris Olympics. To cut a long story short we needed a lot of hotel rooms at very short notice and you can imagine how hard this is at this in the run up to the Olympics. My heart was in my stomach as I really didn’t it would be possible but the Bastille Patio pulled it off. They liaised with our travel agent who is 3 hours ahead of France and we were able to book exactly what we needed.

I kindly asked if she could call her manager and she rudely denied our request and made us wait til the next day.

For a price of €5,500 per year we have the right to expect a minimum in terms of teaching, but this money is invested in brand new premises and not in qualified teachers. Once again, the school is above all a company whose objective is to make a profit, and to do this, it favors good communication with pretty photos of the brand new premises while filtering the opinions on the internet as best as possible: Negative reviews about the school are deleted to keep false, glowing reviews from people who have never set foot in this school. The business of this company consists of recovering students who have missed the APB mark: as places in the public sector remain difficult to access, it offers training so as not to lose a year. This is entirely commendable, however, the quality of the training there is less good than in the public according to some of my classmates who have tested both. If you have the choice between a company of this type and between the public, do not hesitate to choose the public: it is cheaper and you will be better trained there. In addition, I would like to point out that you cannot change for the public during training, due to the fact that the Cours Diderot is not under contract with the State. The best choice is therefore to choose a semi-public school, i.e. under contract: you will be supervised there with regard to expectations during exams.\nRegarding internships, count on your contacts to find a solution, the school does not help with the procedures except to remind you of the regulatory dates.\n\nOtherwise, the positive thing is that the school is well located, the premises are new and well equipped. A very meager compensation therefore...\n\nA fairly negative assessment so, if I had to do it again, I would not have chosen this school but would rather have opted for the public. I hope that this opinion will have made it possible to combat the misinformation practiced by the school and will have been useful to young high school graduates about to embark on the path to higher education: don't repeat the same mistakes as me!""]",11e

Thanks and keep up the good services.', 'I stayed at this hotel with my family for 5 nights. I was very reluctant at first when I read all the reviews, mainly because I was afraid of being stolen. However, I was pleasantly surprised not only of not being stolen, but one morning I left my very expensive iPhone in the dining room. The guys at the reception found it  gave it to me even before I realised it was missing. Cleaning was very good, despite all the bad comments, the cleaning ladies did their job every day. The 2 rooms we have booked were very clean, I did not find any mold and everything was in very good condition. Breakfast was more than ok, the hotel was clean and the staff was great, I did not have any problems at this hotel. It felt quite comfortable and quiet, this hotel.

I don't know what the criteria are for that, but I really wouldn't call it anything more than a 3.\n\nThe rooms are small, but that's forgivable as that is expected for hotel rooms in Europe. But the space was just not pleasant. There were no drawers to put anything in, no hooks for towels, and just not much surface area to put things down on generally. With two of us staying in there, it became quite messy pretty quickly as it was hard to keep it orderly.\n\nNow let's talk about discomfort. Again, I can forgive small. The bed for the 2 of us was smaller than a US queen. That was fine. But, as seems to be the custom in many hotels these days, the bed is covered with only a single duvet—no sheets or layers. The pillows were lumpy and the springs creaked. Worst of all, no matter how high I turned up the AC or widely I opened the window, it was persistently warm in the room—the duvet would have made it worse, and I wished I just had a sheet to cover me, but alas, I laid sleepless and sweating on the unplush pillows, awake without much room to get into a comfortable position.\n\nAs a positive, the breakfast was not horrible. Not anything truly special, but the scrambled eggs, crepes, pains au chocolat, and specialty coffee machine did what they needed to do. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly enough.\n\nAnd although the hotel is not located in a very central area, it is conveniently located within a 10-minute or less walk from a couple of Metro lines, and the frequent service made traveling in and out of the tourist zones a breeze. But that is a compliment to the Metro, not this hotel."", 'Having never traveled to Europe, we didn’t know what to expect in hotels and chose to stay with Best Western as they are a good hotel to stay in in the states.

Hallways were quite small and stairs were small. The location was great, it was out of the main tourist area, quiet, and places to eat were within walking distance.

These rooms are not adequately designed to accommodate 8 beds. Beds 3 through 6 are positioned extremely close together, resulting in occupants sleeping practically side-by-side. These beds are only separated by a minimal barrier. Furthermore, the toilets and bathrooms are outdated and in a state of disrepair.\n\nAdditionally, be aware that luggage storage is subject to a fee of 2 to 6 euros. However, you will be charged the full 6 euros regardless of the storage duration, whether it's one hour or six hours."", 'Immaculate hostel. Staff are so friendly. Check in process was quick and efficient. I love the LED lights around the hallways and the bathrooms are gorgeous and very clean. Would definitely go again. 5 stars! ⭐️👏💯', 'Joe&Joe Paris - Nation is a refreshing departure from the usual accommodation choices in Paris. Over the past few years, there has been a surge of alternative lodging options, and Joe&Joe stands out for its unique blend of a hostel vibe with a concert-like atmosphere. If you’re looking for luxury, this might not be the place for you, but if you’re seeking an adventurous, creative, and down-to-earth experience, Joe&Joe delivers exactly that.\n\nThe rooms are minimalist, almost evoking the feel of being backstage at a music venue. While the décor is pared down to the essentials, everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided. The beds, though covered in a fake leather or plastic material that can get humid at times, are surprisingly soft and comfortable. I slept soundly for three nights. The one downside might be that the rooms are a bit dark, but that seems to match the aesthetic of the place.\n\nWhere Joe&Joe truly shines is in its service and atmosphere. The staff is exceptionally friendly and welcoming, going out of their way to ensure guests feel at home. Upon departure, we even received hugs, which speaks volumes about the personal touch they provide. Though we didn’t have breakfast there, the coffee was excellent, and we opted to explore the city’s brunch scene instead.\n\nThe bathroom and shower facilities are modern and spotless, adding a touch of luxury to an otherwise stripped-back room setup. Despite the simplistic accommodations, the lively and warm environment, combined with the excellent service, made our stay memorable. We will definitely recommend Joe&Joe to others and will likely return ourselves.', ""+ Best location (Metro 9 - just around the corner less than 1 mins)\n+ Amazing and friendly staff\n+ Super clean rooms and toilets.\n+ Clean bed sheets\n\n+ Breakfast is great for the price but lack varieties a little bit day by day (Same option everyday atleast change the fruits or bread types etc)\n\nFor the price, Unless you're a difficult person they check all my boxes if you want more go 5 star Hotels😀😃😄.\n\n+ Even the room door open/close was sound proof kinda of you dont disturb overs mid-night etc."", ""Overall the experience was okay. The staff are friendly.\nNevertheless since im out the whole day , when i use the bathroom at night , the sink are not clean , and there's water everywhere in the bathroom.\nAnd another disadvantage which i pointed out with the staff is the system with the luggage , since im a client , normally check-out is at 10 am , and if im checking out earlier the charges for keeping luggage should start after 10 am , instead of when we're actually keeping the bag.\nIts almost like a scam 😕""]",20e

There were visible remnants from previous occupants, such as red lint on surfaces and noticeable finger smudges across the mirrored bathroom walls—a key feature of the room. Additionally, our room was located at the end of a hallway, next to ongoing construction and the service elevators, making it exceptionally noisy and nearly impossible to sleep.\n\nAn unpleasant moment occurred during check-in when a staff member showed us to our room.

The constant noise made it hard to sleep, and the hotel did nothing to manage the situation.\n\nOverall, Hôtel Lord Byron is far from worth the price. The small rooms, rude staff, and constant noise made for a very unpleasant stay.

Check-in was smooth and welcoming, setting the tone for a memorable stay. The thoughtful touches for my daughter, like the adorable Pow mascot, the kid-friendly map of Paris, and the treasure hunt, were pure magic. It was these small, considerate gestures that made her feel so special—and made me feel so supported.\n\nA particular highlight was the chef cutting an apple into what felt like a million perfect slices, just because that’s all my daughter wanted to eat (apart from the croissants, of course!). The concierge team was incredible, with impeccable recommendations and bookings that made exploring Paris both seamless and exciting.\n\nAnd then there was the moment that truly set Grand Powers apart: the personal errand they assisted me with at the very last minute, despite time pressures and the rain. Their willingness to go above and beyond left me speechless and incredibly grateful.\n\nTo the entire team at Hotel Grand Powers, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

The views from our balcony were amazing, although we didn’t have a direct view of the Eiffel Tower, we were still able to catch glimpses and enjoyed watching her sparkle at night from our balcony.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was plentiful with many options. We appreciated the option to enjoy our breakfast in room, which we did multiple times during our stay. We didn’t have an opportunity to try anything from their dinner menu, but we did notice the menu included many vegan and gluten-free options.\n\nThe best part of our stay was the service! Everyone we met at Grand Powers was so kind and helpful. Upon leaving, the concierge booked an airport taxi for us which helped make our experience much more seamless. One thing that stood out to me, actually that my daughter pointed out, was that they had umbrellas next to the door for guests to use while out. Although it didn’t rain during our stay, one thing we did not pack with us was an umbrella, so this would have been very welcome. Sometimes it truly is the little things.\n\nOur stay was 10/10.

The way they talk wasn’t polite either. Our experience for breakfast was very good and the stuff were outstanding. The room was a disappointment. In my personal opinion it was not worth the money. The sheets were dirty in check-in and bathroom wasn’t very clean either. We came on winter and the room was freezing as the windows don’t have double glazing. You could feel the breeze around. Also behind the tv they had a pocket inside the wall to allocate all the cables. Somethings must have happened to the cover for it. They only put some tape over it instead.

The service was EXCEPTIONAL, I have stayed at many 5 stars hotel before in different countries, but Le Burgundy really made us feel so warm and special and welcomed everyday!

Traveling is meant to be a change of atmosphere, but we were met with an overwhelming amount of rudeness from the staff and a dirty environment.\n- Upon arrival, the reception greeted us without a smile, welcome, or any kindness. Instead of giving us the room we requested, we were given an inferior one after extending our stay, they switched us.\n- The cleaning staff were extremely rude. For instance, the worker who cleaned our room filled our water bottles from the tap (which is not safe to drink). We reported this to the manager, but it kept happening without resolution.\n- When we moved rooms, we forgot two books and informed the reception, where an Asian staff member began investigating whether one of the books was related to magic, suggesting that the cleaner may have discarded them due to their content. This level of rudeness was unbelievable.\n- The Asian receptionist displayed racial bias, referring to guests by their nationalities in a derogatory manner. For example, when Japanese guests arrived, she called them “Japan”  in front of us.\n- Her demeanor was unprofessional, as she was eating while talking to us, and her attire was not suitable for a hotel reception role.\n- The overall cleanliness was unacceptable; the rooms were filthy, and despite the attractive decor, the dirtiness detracted from the experience. In our second room, the tables had coffee spilled on them, further highlighting the lack of attention to cleanliness.\n- We encountered issues in the small cafeteria below, where the staff refused to serve coffee in a glass cup and argued with us for a long time. He kept asking why don’t we use paper cups instead.\n- The cleanliness of the entire place was poor. Even the shared areas were dirty, with hair everywhere, and the private spa was very dirty dust in the pool and they served us water in used dirty cups although the spa was supposed to be privately booked and cleaned for us.\n- In the end, I have no idea why the staff treated us this way. They should have been welcoming, but we were the ones who tried to greet them kindly, only to be met with disdain.\n- The manager attempted to resolve these issues, but I believe the entire staff needs to be changed for any improvement to occur.', 'The Hotel was relatively easy to get to and the service was very welcoming and good. The rooms were very comfortable and the only thing I would have preferred was pressure in the shower was a little light. Other than this the Hotel was very nice and comfortable.', 'The hotel has got an excellent location very close to the main shopping streets. We traveled with 2 kids and our room was very nice, clean and spacious. The main bed was very comfortable king size bed. Also the other sofa bed was good for kids.

It was in a great location we had missed in our scouting so we began to stay there on a regular basis.\n\nThat was 15 years ago.\n\ni think the heart of the hotel comes from management. :Ludovic Peressni has been the manager during all that time and the consistency of good service and fanatical cleanliness.  The staff stays up to date on the latest of restaurants and places to visit or shop. Of course you're walking distance from Galleries Lafayette and Printemps, along with dozens of other shopping stores. The location of this hotel is incredible, and over the last 15 years we have developed about a 15 block area we know very well from the hotel as center. There's everything you need those blocks , but just come and explore around.\n\nA New Change\n\nA couple of years ago a hotel firm purchased Hotel Lavoisier. They announced a major renovation and much of it has been completed. The lobby, new breakfast area, and rooms have all been totally renovated. It has been done beautifully.

The air conditioning in the room barely works, it was HOT! I had to open up the window in the middle of the night. The floor is very dirty, I can tell because I used a wet wipe and gave the floor a swipe and the wipe was pitch dark. The bed was comfortable but I think there was an issue with laundry so the sheets had a very unpleasant smell. It smells like sweat. I have to give the bathroom some credit because I really enjoyed the shower. The water pressure was very strong and the bathroom was big compared to other hotels in Paris.

Walking into the hotel, it’s beautifully adorned and sets the tone for a good stay, for a 4 star hotel. However upon check in is where the problems started. We booked on booking dot com and paid in advance, however the staff (front office manager) asked for my credit card for payment. I told her we’d already paid in full upfront and she snarly said “I don’t think so”…. I told her to double check and she said oh yeah… no apology for the remark. Strange how the front office manager could make such error.. had I not checked, I would have been charged again.\nWe made our way up to the room… an hour later I had a call saying that my AMEX card was in the lobby as the staff didn’t return it to me. They didn’t bring it to the room or apologise, so I made my way down to collect it.\nThe entire aura and lack of manners from the staff is disappointing. Not one smile, not an apology.\nThe next day, the shower gel was not replenished, despite us using it all. The amenities are not up to standard for a 4 star hotel at a price of over 200€ per night. After the second night, still no replies of shower gel so I complained to the front office. Again, no apology, the staff just scrabbled to find a spare small bottle of shower gel in the drawer at front office. Besides this, there are no cotton buds or any other basic amenities you’d expect, no kettle, no tea or coffee, no water.  I have had better amenities in 2 star hotels. This hotel is 2 star parading as 4 star just because they have a restaurant onsite and a concierge service.\n\nUpon checkout we were asked how many rooms, and how many adults in the room.. strange questions. No thank you for the stay or any form of sincerity.\n\nLocation is fantastic and the lobby and restaurant are beautiful. Complete let down from the staff (apart from bellboy who is friendly).\n\nMy advice to management: stop being so cheap and greedy. Provide proper amenities that reflect the level and cost of the hotel. Train your staff or hire people that actually want to be in hospitality.\nAlso, bed sheets and carpet have stains and holes. Not acceptable.', 'Good place , but I hated that the toilet is separate from the shower and sink! Imagine using the toilet then need to open tow doors to wash your hands.. there is no slippers, rope, tooth brush, water, or coffee corner.. if you need boiling water you need to go to the lobby to have one otherwise they will charge you for room service if they bring it to you.. the last thing about the open buffet I didn’t like it at all ( eggs, yogurt, cereal, mini croissants, sausages, and a small plate with 3 type of cheese only!! ) and it was pricey']",8e

The price is great for Paris which is famously expensive for even budget hotels. The location is great and central. The hotel has been recently renovated with quite cool paint colours and decorations (although the finish is a bit messy). The hotel receptionists were very helpful with letting us leave our baggage with them after checkout. Breakfast included which is good for saving some money in Paris - we were late to breakfast but the receptionists still let us go and have some food, which was appreciated.\n\nCONS\nOur hotel room was so, so, so small it honestly felt claustrophobic. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom I've ever seen. There was approximately 30cm of floor space that wasn't the toilet or the shower. Showering was extremely unpleasant because it was so cramped. The room is covered in mirrors (presumably to make the room feel bigger) but it just means you can constantly see reflections of yourself which isn't very nice. The bathroom was also a bit dirty. The room was very hot at night.\n\nBecause of this despite the good price I wouldn't stay at this hotel again. Pay a bit more and have room to move around and use the bathroom without feeling boxed in."", 'Room is small even for Paris standards and are deceiving in photos. The shower stall is in the bedroom, not inside a bathroom behind a door. Lead to the bedroom smelling like mold and having a lot of humidity. The toilet/sink area does have a door however you can barely close with the space provides for your legs. There is a small area to hang clothes but you cannot really use it because the bed blocks access. Good aspects include the front staff who are very welcoming and helpful, nice sitting area, the bed is comfortable and windows keep noise out well from street. Location is central however a bit sleepy compared to other areas of Paris.', ""Absolutely loved this charming hotel. The staff were extremely nice and helpful. They always greeted us with a smile, and we're always more than willing to answer any of our questions about the city.  The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The location is exquisite, right in the heart of Paris. You can walk anywhere within minutes and the neighborhood is beautiful. I would recommend getting a room on the third floor. The views out of the window were well worth the climb. I will definitely stay here again."", 'As expected, it is petite and even more petite when you get there.

I wouldn't recommend it and I definitely won't choose it again! Bad experience…"", 'Save yourself a headache\n\nWe expected a relaxing stay at what we thought was a reputable establishment, but what we got was a complete disaster.

We tried asking to pay extra to make sure the second guest ( my husband) was allowed to stay. They still refused and told us it was our problem.\n\nTo make matters worse, this all happened after midnight, leaving us stranded in a foreign city with no place to stay.

The concierge refused us entry — and rather than try to work with us to come to a solution such as perhaps paying extra for the evening, refused us entry and refused us any refund. This was after midnight, so we were left to find a hotel on our own.\n\nAs you can see from other public reviews, this appears to be a recurring issue with this ownership, which appears to have changed recently.

Their rooms have NO storage space so if you are going to be staying with family, this place is not for you.\n3. The alleys and lift in the entire building is claustrophobic.\n4. None of the rooms have doorbells\n5. The staff is extremely rude and doesn’t care what you do after you’ve paid them money\n6. No assistance whatsoever required. Their only answer to all questions is, “we cannot do anything.”\n\nSuch people should not be in the hospitality sector. Zero respect for people, zero concern for customer  issues. The entire experience was harrowing.\n\nSincerely wish I could rate this place in negative.']",8e

We would NOT book that same room type again as it was about 250 Eur Per night more expensive than a King Premium.

Only problem is that the tub didn’t hold water.  We informed the hotel 3 times and the engineer  came to “fix” it but he didn’t fix it as it kept slowly draining.  I will say the front desk was very apologetic and gave us one night stay for free.  I appreciated the gesture as it essentially knocked the cost of my room down to that lower rate type.  Otherwise the room was very clean, and they offered turn down service daily. But again a but overpriced for what you get.\n\nService: Good and bad.  At check-in our room wasn’t ready (we arrived early). The front desk offered free breakfast as well as free drinks in the lobby.  Such a nice welcoming gesture that they didn’t have to offer.

The door persons never really smiled or greeted you upon return and once you were in the hotel, it was so big that it was hard to get “personalized” attention.\n\nAs I said above, I would stay here again due to the cleanliness and location.

This was about 45 mins after breakfast was supposed to have started.\n\nThe central heating is also problematic.  Rooms do not have individual temperature controls so I find it gets quite hot.  I\'d happily open the window but due to noise (see below) that\'s not an option.  In addition to the massive issues detailed below even on a \'good\' night you have people calling out throughout the square etc (there are a couple of homeless people that seem to use it too) which kept others awake until they closed their windows.\n\nNow the major issue.  Noise.\n\nThere is a public square across the road.  On my first evening at the hotel I checked in and was told absolutely nothing about this - however, there was a commercial/movie being filmed in this square and it started in the early evening and did not finish until 5am.  Having had no sleep I was grateful that it had finally ended.  But no, the noise continued with trucks reversing and beeping as they dismantled the set for several more hours.\n\nNow upon my return visit it is a wedding reception.  Guests started arriving around 7pm and at 3:45am I am writing this review, once again with no sleep and once again with an abundance of noise coming from this square.  People are drinking and loudly chatting on the street immediately in front of the hotel, not inside the marquee though the piano is still getting a workout, possibly by guests, as a poor level of music is being performed eg Chopsticks.\n\nThis is an expensive hotel and for this price point there are many superior hotels to stay in.  Choose another one.\n\nWhat is most disappointing is that on both occasions the hotel did not inform me.  They could have offered ear plugs, a reduced rate, a free drink etc.  Nothing.  Why on earth anyone would pay full price to have no sleep I do not know.  Who wants to walk around Paris like a zombie?\n\nFor it to have happened twice it must be a regular occurrence.  I did mention it to hotel staff when I saw the marquee being set up yesterday to which I was told it wouldn\'t bother me as there are many neighbours and people using the square are not allowed to make noise.  When I mentioned that it had kept me away only two weeks ago he replied, ""I\'ll inform my colleague.""\n\nAs you may imagine, that was the last I heard of it and I\'m having my second sleepless night in Fauvart.\n\nTruly, stay elsewhere.  Paris is full of marvellous options, this isn\'t one of them.\n\n(Photo taken at 3:30am. Finally finished at 3:45am. It’s now 6:05am and they’ve been dismantling for the past 2 hours and 20 mins, banging and crashing and yelling the whole time).', 'My husband and I throughly enjoyed our stay here.\n\nIt was a very last minute honeymoon trip so we didn’t have much time to prepare.

Initially, we had made a reservation through Airbnb, but due to a last-minute cancellation, we found ourselves without accommodations. After arriving at Saint-Lazare railway station, exhausted from our flight, we decided to explore nearby options. Roughly 100 meters from the station, we discovered this hotel. After reviewing the rates, we decided to stay for one night.\n\nThe hotel’s location was highly convenient, with easy access to the train station, Metro, and bus routes. Due to this, we opted to extend our stay for several more nights. However, the hotel itself was quite dated. The wallpaper, furniture, and decor appeared to be from a bygone era, though everything was still functional. Additionally, since the hotel is located near an underground station, every time a train arrived or departed, the building would vibrate, accompanied by loud noise, which could be disruptive for light sleepers. For us, it wasn’t a major issue, but it’s worth noting for those sensitive to noise.\n\nHaving worked in travel and hospitality for 35+ years, I found the customer service at the reception particularly concerning. We interacted with three staff members, two of whom were male and extremely rude and unprofessional, raising questions about their suitability for working in hospitality.\n\nUpon check-in, we were given a family room with two double beds. When we extended our stay, the same female receptionist confirmed that we could remain in the same room. However, on Saturday, a male receptionist questioned why we were occupying a family room despite being only two guests. We explained that this was the room initially assigned to us, and the female receptionist had allowed us to extend our stay in the same room. He disregarded this and demanded that we move to a smaller room immediately, or else he would be forced to charge us double the amount per night, even though we were just about to leave for the day. When we mentioned the arrangement with the previous receptionist, he bluntly responded, “I don’t care what she said; I make the decisions here.” The conversation escalated, and he even said, “If you want trouble, I’ll give you trouble.”\n\nAlthough he ultimately let us stay in the family room for that night, the experience left a sour taste and affected our day. The female receptionist, while somewhat better, also displayed mood swings. We asked to speak with the hotel manager, but the staff refused to provide contact information, with each person acting as if they were the manager or owner. As a result, we avoided any further interaction with the reception, even though there were some issues in the room we wanted to resolve.\n\nWhile the hotel’s location is excellent, the outdated facilities and subpar customer service severely diminished the overall experience.', 'Rooms below average, not very soundproof.

Their attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile did not go unnoticed.\n\nThank you, Westminster Hotel, for an unforgettable stay! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris. We can’t wait to return!', 'If you\'re considering staying at this hotel, please read this first.\n\nLet me start with the reception staff—they are extremely unfriendly and indifferent, as if they\'re being forced to work. An hour after we checked into our room, a cleaning staff member entered without knocking. We stayed for three days, and our room was never cleaned. We left the hotel at 10 a.m. and returned around 4-5 p.m., and only once, after we got back around 5 p.m., did they knock on our door and shamelessly ask, ""Do you need cleaning?""\n\nAdditionally, it’s impossible to even find water in the room because you need to call room service to order it, which is charged separately. On top of that, you also have to pay a service fee for room service. Over the course of three days, I spent €100 on water alone. Instead of focusing on guest satisfaction, their sole goal seems to be figuring out how to charge you more.\n\nThere is no soundproofing in the rooms. We kept waking up from the noise of people walking in the room above us because the ceiling is made of false panels that flex with every step, making it feel unsafe.\n\nIf you want to order food from room service, it\'s very difficult to get in touch with them—you often have to try several times. Even when we managed to place an order, the food was terrible, and it was 1.5 times more expensive than the nearby restaurants.\n\nOverall, for a hotel with a nightly rate of €1,100 for a suite, we didn’t even get the level of service you’d expect from a €200 hotel. The hotel has severe operational issues, so be prepared for many unpleasant surprises.', 'It was a complete fiasco. Despite booking a suite room, it was one of the worst experiences we’ve ever had. The room wasn’t properly cleaned, they forgot to provide water, and even when we requested some, we were treated poorly. The woman who brought coffee to the room said something in French, which probably wasn’t very pleasant. After 9:30 PM, there’s no room service, and the meals were terrible. In summary, it was an experience of being humiliated despite paying.', 'The hotel location is excellent. Most of the brands, restaurants, Coffees are nearby. The Opera and Auber Metro stations are nearby. The Reception staff are friendly.  The room size is big, Furniture condition is deluxe with comfortable bed. The breakfast is very good.', 'A 3-3.5 star hotel at best. There are no cameras on each floor. Anyone can walk from the lobby straight up the stairs to the rooms. As a couple, we were given 2 single beds squished together, when we requested a double bed, they said they’d come in the evening to fix. They just put the two beds together again with one sheet over both beds. This is how my partner and I spent our sleeps for 1 week over our 2025 new years. My partner is 180cm and had to sleep diagonally over this gap. What a joke.\n\nSome days they gave us water, most days they didn’t. They didn’t clean our tea cups in the room as part of room cleaning either unless we left it out on the table. When we called for some water, because we weren’t given any after room cleaning on NEW YEARS DAY, we were asked for 9 euro. The photos look better than what the place really is. Not satisfied at all for the price we paid. Furnishings just feel old and theres a smell in the elevator; which is also tiny. It was about $4000 euro/ usd for the whole week. Really worthy to get Airbnb or a better known hotel brand for this price. The only good thing about this place is the location. No idea how it’s 4 stars; I travel and stay in hotels 6 months+ out of the year. This was interesting.']",2e

I had the pleasure of staying at the hotel de Noailles (Paris) for a number of days for a recent business trip. At first, the size of the accommodations put me off.

I wasn’t looking forward to the week.\n\nI mentioned this to one of the people at the front-desk the next day and they were able to relocate me and move everything for me. That was just the beginning of the fantastic service. I spent a lot of time in the common area of the hotel, from morning breakfasts to drinks after work at the hotel bar, and really got to know the staff.  That is when I learned that this was a 4th generation family run business, which I loved hearing. Justine Caresmel lead the service charge in my mind. She personally made it her mission to ensure that I had a great time under their care. Lina was also incredibly nice as was the rest of the staff.  If you ever go there, you must meet the brother bartenders (Harkham and Ossman), who are fantastic and very fun to talk to.\n\nOverall, this was an amazing stay because of the service from the staff who took personal ownership into ensuring that everyone had a great stay.', ""I stayed only one night but wish I could have stayed longer.

Also, the sound of the doors closing in the rooms is very liberating. In my opinion, all hotel guests can't be so inconsiderate as to close the room door with a lot of noise. There may have been a technical glitch. Of course, there was no problem in our room.\nConsidering that we left the hotel in the morning after breakfast and returned at night and were not in the hotel during the day, these issues were not very important to us.\nRegarding the first breakfast, I must thank the lady who was in charge of this department, because everything was clean, tidy and perfect. The charging of materials was done quickly and she was truly unique.\nThe breakfast menu of this hotel was acceptable in my opinion.

Below is my detailed critique based on my experience:\n\nRoom and Facilities\n\nThe cleanliness of the room and bathroom was satisfactory; however, both are in dire need of major renovation. The outdated design and worn-out fixtures give the entire space an unappealing and neglected feel. Additionally, the room was shockingly small, the tiniest I’ve ever encountered—definitely not what one expects from a 4-star property. While basic amenities were provided, I had to request slippers and a robe, which I consider standard for this category.\n\nService and Staff\n\nThe front desk staff were helpful, but the lack of a concierge service immediately lowered the overall standard. The hotel operates more like a self-service property, which is disappointing for a 4-star brand. For example, requests for items like cups and towels were met with instructions to retrieve them myself from the front desk, which felt unprofessional and inconvenient.\n\nDining and Breakfast\n\nI did not have any meals at the hotel, so I cannot comment on the food quality or service. However, the absence of any memorable dining experiences further underscores the lack of appeal.\n\nLocation\n\nThe location was adequate but far from ideal. While it served its purpose, it was not particularly convenient for sightseeing or accessing key attractions.\n\nValue for Money\n\nThe most frustrating aspect of the stay was the poor value for money. For a hotel marketed as 4-star, the experience felt far below expectations. From carrying my own luggage to the room via a small elevator to the self-service nature of nearly all interactions, the hotel lacked the polish and service typically associated with its rating. Back home, our 3-star hotels would easily outshine this property, and this experience was simply not worth the price.\n\nOverall Impression\n\nThe stay at Hôtel Mercure Paris Opéra Faubourg Montmartre was underwhelming, and I cannot recommend this property to others. The combination of outdated rooms, minimal service, and poor value has also made me reconsider staying with Accor hotels in Europe in the future. For the price paid, guests deserve far more than what this hotel offers.', 'Very friendly and helpful staff, which was a highlight of our stay.  The shower was not designed well, as lots of water escaped under the swinging door. Breakfast was plentiful and very good.', 'I cannot give it more than 2 stars. You’re literally just paying for a bed. Very poor design. Below basic. No wardrobe, just a tiny curtain with a very short hanging bar that allows you to hang a shirt but definitely no dresses. It says it’s family friendly. The “closet” wouldn’t even fit the clothes of 1 person.. so 2 people + baby would be impossible. Certainly I would never recommend it to anyone.

Closet was sufficient for storing clothes and I was able to store my suitcases out of the way.\n\nOur sink did clog, and while it wasn’t the worst thing, there was no maintenance or cleaning staff on site in the evening hours to fix it (it was a very quick fix). I suppose that’s a con of staying at a small hotel. It was also very (and unseasonably) warm while we were there. It took an act of congress to get the air on as it’s controlled by the building. The noise level is about an 11 out of 10, but manageable with earplugs. Lastly, there was a flood in the building during our stay, and while that’s a factor out of their control, it was sort of the icing on the cake coupled with everything else I just mentioned.']",3e

My experience at this hotel is a very bad one, given that the shower doesn't work properly and it splits water all over the floor when used, the toilet is placed so as there is not enogh space to use it and the sink is very, very little.

Appi has a huge sign that says check in at 12:30, room wasn’t ready until 13:30. We show up and the room has wires coming out of the walls, outlets are just hanging there. Towel is like sandpaper. Window, walls, and doors are paper thin. The shared toilet is located directly on the stairs so everyone walking by can hear literally everything and the door does not have a lock on it, so people can just open it. The pictures on Booking and Google are extremely deceiving. This hotel is a slum.', ""Original photos were deleted!\nIf no stars were an option i would choose 0.

Bad renovations, Dirty worn out sheets, filty bathroom and floors,sink in bathroom leaked water into the room. Wardrobe was falling apart and the room was so noisey, you could hear everything from the street. We could not stay there we booked alternate accommodation. After speaking to staff and asking to be refunded they have not replied or followed up any of our emails or phone calls. Please do not waste your time or money going to this hotel.

The electric heater workes smothly.\nShared bathroom was good although a bit small.\nCould sleep well on the bed even tho I am 6ft4in.\nThere was hot water 24 hours a day.\nDidnt have insects at all( like I have read)\nThe guy working there was very friendly and spoke English very well."", ""I would like it to be known i have a fairly high tolerance for putting up with a bad situation, generally to avoid the slightest bit of conflict. That said, I can honestly say a majority of my time spent in the Appi Hotel, was demanding a refund for the night that I was not going to spend there.\n\nWhen i originally booked there, I read the reviews prior. What I read was either good, or awful, but all fairly vague. The biggest cons that stood out in the reviews were; the area, the shared restroom, stairs, thin walls, and one mentioned bed bugs.\n\nWith reading all that, the pros of the cost and proximity to train station seemed to outweigh them. There were comments mentioning how none of those things, except for the bedbugs, were as bad as they seemed. After weighing everything out, I decided to book.\n\nOnce I checked in, I saw that all the poor comments about the hotel were accurate. The shared restroom, is shared with the entire building. The toilet room, on the 3rd floor, was a toilet in a room just big enough to close the door when you sit down. There was no elbow room, toilet paper, or sink in it. It was filthy and clogged. The shower was in a room not much bigger than the toilet room, equally dirty. With the thin walls I could hear when someone went into the office two floors below. The main issue that I found with the stairs, was that they were all bowed in and was more of a hazard going up and especially down.\n\nA homeless person living on the streets, who had a good day of panhandling, probably wouldn't mind the fact that the doors don't shut all the way or the heat doesn't work. Someone backpacking through Europe from hostel to hostel might enjoy the slight increase in privacy, for the trade off of cleanliness. Someone who is lonely for the night, will enjoy all the strip clubs, sex shops, and hookers that fill the rest of the street, and probably doesn't mind the cheap, dirty bed.\n\nFor someone who wants even the basics of what you would expect in a hotel, should book elsewhere. I could get a room in a different hotel for only 20 dollars more, but it was exponentially better in every aspect.""]",2e

It is clear from previous reviews that hotel management is aware of the quality of their staff yet nothing was done to improve the situation. Our stay here was a very unpleasant experience, not one that you would want to remember Paris with. I absolutely do not recommend this hotel!\n\nUpdate:\nThe response of the hotel director to my review speaks volumes about his level of professionalism. I am no longer surprised by the rudeness of his staff, it all flows from the top. You are wrong Mr. Marlo, this is not a review by the same person from two different accounts. Two adults shared a room in your hotel and each posted a separate review about their poor experience at your establishment.', 'The room was quite small and the cleaners were very rude. They kept waking me up knocking on the door like crazy even when I put the ""do not disturb"" sign on my door, they kept shouting in the corridor as well, it was very hard to get some proper rest in this hotel because of them. They also took my cups away instead of replacing them for some reason. I even found some bread crumbs on my table even if I never ate in my room... Good thing the bed was comfortable and the location was good.', 'Worst of the many Paris hotels I’ve stayed at. Staff are uniformly rude and unhelpful, and some are directly confrontational. Breakfast price? Depends on who you ask. Wireless not working? Must be the fault of guest phones. Breakfast staff spend their time eating and drinking, not refilling supplies or helping guests. Next time I’d cancel my trip before staying at this miserable place.', 'The reception staff are very pleasant. The toilet lid in our room was broken, but it’s good that they promptly changed the room to another one.\nHowever, the cleaning was poor, there was dust and the toilet was dirty with marks.\nThere are no cups for toothbrushes in the bathroom. The hairdryer is so inconvenient that your hand gets tired very quickly while drying your hair.\n\nOverall a fairly spacious room, as for Paris, with a large and comfortable bed. A bit noisy because there are renovation works and bars going on nearby.\n\nBreakfast is normal, but could be better, there are no any vegetables.\nEXPIRED mustard, ketchup and mayonnaise. When we noticed this and showed it to the staff, she was surprised, but didn’t remove them from the table))\nThe good thing was orange fresh juice, but it ran out on the third day.', 'Overall, the hotel room was clean and located in a convenient neighborhood. However, I had significant issues with the customer service. With the exception of Alexander who was very polite and helpful, the other two male staff members at the reception were quite the opposite.\n\nWhen I first checked in, French Male Staff #1 did not ask for my passport or identification after hearing my name. When I questioned his lack of procedure, he claimed he was trying to ""make me feel comfortable."" When I suggested it was unsafe to just let guests in without checking, he became defensive and threatened to ""make my stay less comfortable"" by redoing all the checks with a bad attitude. He then sent me to the wrong room, so I had to go downstairs again to get the correct room card. He criticized my mother for not handing the wrong card ""gently"" when placing it on the table to him, and proceeded to lecture us on doing things with ""French manners"". He also laughed at my family in French, in front of another guest which he didn’t realize we overheard and understood while waiting for the elevator doors to close.\n\nOn the second day, I saw some cups in the lobby and apparently it’s for guests to use so I took one and went to reception informing Indian Staff #2 that I had taken one. Instead of acknowledging ,he rudely said “you must ask me first”, which shocked me. When I questioned why he was so rude to me, he insisted “because its universal manners to ask first as this is France"", implying again thay I am not familiar with “French manners”.\n\nBoth incidents could have been handled more professionally and courteously! As a regular global traveler, I am very familiar with what hotel guests can/cannot do so I found their lecturing attitude very unprofessional and inappropriate.\n\nAlthough the hotel room itself was decent, I do not plan to return and will sure stay in another hotel in our next visit. I hope the management can train their staff to behave more professionally. If they cannot appreciate foreigners, they should reconsider their roles in hospitality, as their behaviour reflects poorly on Parisian tourism. I was very shocked by this attitude as it is during Olympics season, how can Paris host such a large international event with this kind of attitude? It\'s a shame, as I would have otherwise rated this place at least 4 stars.']",9e

There was only one fully working electrical outlet and that was where the tv was plugged in, far from the bed and basically at head height. This was very inconvenient for charging our phones.

The bed itself was also quite hard and not that comfortable.\n\nBut our biggest problem was the noise. We are usually not sensitive to that, but this was quite bizarre. Just outside our room there was a phone on the wall and it was CONSTANTLY ringing. We think the staff used it for internal communication, but it made it quite unbearable to stay in the room daytime.\n\nThere was also a LOT of noise from the cleaning staff that slammed with vacuum cleaners and shouted to each other through the corridor for hours. We do not expect silence at a hotel, and certainly the cleaning has to be done, but it went on like this day in and day out. At one point a cleaning lady even came into our room while we were having a short afternoon nap. She just bursted in, said something in french and started cleaning the bathroom. Heard about knocking?\n\nOverall the staff in the reception was very blasé and seemed exceptionally uninterested in the guests.

Overall the hotel was great except these few things hope you can fix some of them.', ""Good sized rooms for a city hotel. The beds were comfortable, the room was quiet. Everything was super clean both in the room and communal areas. Enough storage space for clothes and shoes, and a nice TV. The bathroom was very nice, lovely shower and had a nice selection of toiletries.\nThe coffee making facilities in the room are a bit mean - no milk (although there's a small fridge which is really useful) and a couple of tiny paper cups, a few sachets of instant coffee. The cafe and bar area downstairs are nice but a coffee was very expensive (5 or 6 euros) so it would be better to have more options for hot drinks in the room.\nWe used the restaurant for an evening meal - reasonable prices considering how expensive Paris is generally. Not a massively wide menu but it was fine for us, nicely cooked and good service. We also used the bar and cafe area. It's smallish but a nice addition.

It’s not the closest to all the tourist sights but we booked a tour with the Big Bus and it had a pickup spot at the Arc De Triumph which is a short walk from the hotel and we were able to take the bus to get around to all the main attractions in Paris.\n\nI’ll stay here again next time I travel with a toddler to Paris! It’s worth the splurge to be comfortable with kids - something you don’t really get with the boutique hotels in Paris.', 'This is a typical big convention hotel. The food menu is small but good. Breakfast is a big buffet. Prices are reasonable. Our premium room had a great view of the Eiffel Tower. The elevators are awful. You punch in the floor number then it gives you the elevator number. It often doesn’t work well. Crowds back up to go up them. The  lobby bathroom is shared with a mall space and requires a room key to enter. We wanted to have a drink at the sky bar with a window table and couldn’t get in. Maid service was good. Bell stand retrieved a lost bag. It’s clean. Beds and pillows comfortable. The location is very difficult for vehicles to get into because of the traffic patterns. It takes an extra 5 minutes to navigate into it. It would not be my choice unless I was attending a meeting there.', 'We stayed at the Hyatt during our recent trip to Paris. Great hotel in a great location. The check in experience was outstanding. Very friendly service. Our room was very nice. Great views of the Eiffel Tower (Thank your or the upgrade). The beds were very comfortable and nice bathroom and shower. Big TV set. The only thing that did not work very well was the WiFi. Big Lobby area as well. Easy walk to the metro lines. Taxi’s right outside the hotel. We really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt.

Everything is clean and furniture all modern.\n\nHaven't tried the breakfast offerings as we had an unpredictable schedule.\n\nFor laundry there is a coin laundry within walking distance (Paris standards so maybe half km) right beside an amazing pasta restaurant. You can do laundry and get some great pasta with a charming server while you're waiting for your load.\n\nWe traveled around via Uber mostly so I can't speak for the proximity to the usual public transport hubs.\n\nThe only issue I had was when they tried to charge my credit card for the security deposit without informing me first. I was told this was normal and acceptable there, but I don't really know. I told them to tell me beforehand next time and they agreed. There's also a city tax charge of around 20 EUR per day that I wish I knew about beforehand. Lastly, our keycards stopped working a day before our scheduled checkout but this was swiftly corrected by the reception when raised.\n\nA very minor comment perhaps about the rather fascinating and stubborn automatic turnstile entryway/exit which can be rather uncooperative at times. Amusing for able bodied clients, but could be perplexing for those with special needs.\n\nOverall, still a great and decent stay.\n\nApologies for the mess in the photos as we were about to check out at the time.""]",17e

When I book two rooms with same price and same category, I expect I can get two rooms with similar condition. That did not happen this time.\nOne room was OK, but the other room was cramped with bathroom unlike the photos on Expedia with tiny piece of bed. I asked the night receptionist if there was a mistake. He said nothing wrong, nothing he can do but guide me to write an email to the manager. He would not even talk to the manager right away since three manager does not answer the phone on weekends.\nI realized this hotel uses the different definition of “twin” bed. “Twin” bed means one piece of bed no matter how big it is. I can be big or it can be small, but all same twin bed. If that bed lies in a room for 1 person, it is “solo” room with “twin” bed. I got a room with smaller than single size bed.\nI’ve been to many hotels so far, but I’ve never seen this definition and concept of categorization. Night receptionist said nothing wrong because the French tourism committee approved as “solo room with twin bed”.\nI am regretting my poor choice of this hotel in Paris.

The lobby is too small, the breakfast area is similarly compact, and the room was surprisingly tiny. I didn't feel a sense of luxury in this hotel. The shower area was too tight, and the room barely had enough space for a bed. The interior design didn't meet the level expected of a 5-star hotel. The breakfast offered was very modest and limited. Overall, my experience didn't align with a 5-star expectation, and I'm glad I only stayed for one night. On a positive note, the entrance of the hotel has a cute and nice appearance, and the flower decorations on the reception desk were impressive. Despite the limited and below-average breakfast, there were some enjoyable items such as fresh and tasty croissants and a special cinnamon cake. The rooms, although small and lacking in quality interior design, were clean. The hotel's access to some tourist destinations was relatively convenient, not too far away but also not too close."", 'Rooms are small but very clean. Beds are great.', 'The hotel is well placed in the 17th district of Paris. There’s the Palace de Congress nearby with a supermarket inside in case a run is needed, but be aware they close at 8:00PM. A convenience store is located across the street of the hotel and is open 24hr. The subway and train station is about a 10 min walk and using the Paris metro is super easy with the help of the CityMapper app. The hotel workers are also really helpful and kind to allow my small puppy to stay with us in the hotel for a fair price per day. The room with the full bed is a bit small, however, two people can easily fit in it with their luggage if they’re not too big. They were kind enough to also move us to their sister hotel behind this hotel due to it closing for COVID.

Despite its advertised 4-star rating, the hotel fell short in numerous ways, making it feel closer to a 2- or 3-star property at best.\n\nThe Room and Bathroom\nThe room was modest, but the bathroom was particularly disappointing—extremely small, outdated, and poorly maintained. The soap holder was broken and never replaced, leaving the soap dispenser awkwardly placed on the floor. The grout was visibly worn and moldy, and the lack of a shower curtain meant water splashed everywhere during showers. To make matters worse, the bathroom was separated from the room by a non-closing sliding door, offering no real privacy.\n\nMaintenance and Housekeeping Issues\nUpon check-in, I noticed the main light in the room was flickering and eventually stopped working altogether. It took three complaints over three days before this was addressed. The room phone emitted a constant ticking noise that disrupted our sleep, and when I reported it, the staff simply suggested unplugging it rather than fixing it. The lack of a visible maintenance team became glaringly obvious.\n\nHousekeeping was equally disappointing. Towels were no longer refreshed after the third day, and we had to request replacements. Despite asking for daily cleaning, the room was never vacuumed, and it was clear that attention to cleanliness was minimal at best.\n\nSparse Amenities\nFor the price, the amenities were shockingly sparse. There was no fridge or additional conveniences you would expect from a 4-star hotel. Comparatively, our stay at a nearby Hyatt last year—at only a slightly higher cost—was a true 4-star experience in every sense.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis hotel failed to meet even basic expectations for comfort, cleanliness, and service. If you’re considering staying here, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere. Paris offers many excellent accommodations at this price point, and unfortunately, Hotel De Banville is not one of them.\n\nRecommendation: Spend a little extra for a true 4-star experience at a hotel like the Hyatt, where standards are noticeably higher. This was, regrettably, a stay I cannot recommend.', 'We had a fabulous stay - front desk staffs were cordial and efficient. Actually everyone was helpful and friendly.

This was especially problematic given the warm weather, and we were not informed of this issue before receiving the keys. Additionally, the room felt stuffy and the air seemed dusty, making the environment uncomfortable and unpleasant (please, pay EXTRA ATTENTION if you’re allergic to dust)\n\nTo make matters worse, the receptionist, Stefan, was incredibly passive and slow in handling our complaint. Instead of addressing the issue promptly or offering a solution, his attitude was dismissive and arrogant.

Of course, they didn\'t warn us about this beforehand, but they still charged us as if everything was fine.\n\nThe administrator, Stefan, is extremely unprofessional, being rude when you try to discuss the problem. He openly states that they don\'t give refunds, and even said, ""It\'s not that hot outside - you\'ll survive.""\n\nAnother administrator just lies, first saying they\'ll fix the issue, then claiming there\'s an electrical outage in the entire area, and finally mentioning they have a second hotel where everything works. However, this is not true; they have no other functioning hotel, and there\'s no problem with electricity in the area. They wasted two hours with these excuses.\n\nIt feels like they simply can\'t afford to pay for a repairman and are deceiving people.

For example, more wall-mounted hooks would have given us a place to hang clothes and towels.\n\nMy French is limited, to say the least. The young man who checked us in spoke adequate English. The nice woman on the daytime shift appeared to have neither English nor Spanish, so we made do with a lot of smiles and hand gestures.\n\nAll in all, a good place to stay in an excellent location, at a reasonable price for the neighborhood, provided you're willing to accept the limitations of language and very tight space.

Spent 45mins bargaining with us until he conceded to just letting us a working shower next door - after claiming the hotel is completely booked out. When I asked for a partial refund: he implied that he didn’t have to “solve the issue” for us if we didn’t “cooperate”. I believe he meant for us to not make any noise that may affect his position. After 15 mins the real manager came whom had apologized and gave us the better room. She helped with moving our luggage and I believe that deserves some credit. I am baffled at the lies he gave and he attempted at making our request preposterous when we were tried and wanted to have our needs taken care of. For the affordable price, we understand it was just a stay solution. However, the amount of angst and disappointment we felt from this man was entirely unworthy of the savings. The pictures looked more polished than it really is. Dust accumulated in corners. Air conditioning had a loud hum.

We were charged almost €500 / night+breakfast for the Junior room, but got lots of unpleasant experiences. 1.  unpleasant smell in the room. I had to open the door to let go of the smell. 2. Shower water was way too hot to take a shower. Just imagine a guest  standing naked and wet hair trying to figure out how to adjust the water so it won’t get burnt. The room temperature was hot too and there is no thermally control in the room. It can only be controlled by the receptionist from the panel room behind the front desk. 3. Out of frustration, I talked with the receptionist and he suggested me to contact Expedia where I booked the room. It was 12:50 am!! I cannot believe it!! The reason that I give 3 stars for service is because their politeness. Polite but cold. 4.we arrived the hotel before 9 pm and took a walk in the neighborhood.

There are also plenty of clubs on the same street that I could hear at night when I’m trying to sleep. It wasn’t really an issue for me because I can sleep through anything, but I can see how that would be a problem for other guests.']",9e

So I made the trip and just want to know more about this hotel and their staff.\n\nFirst, it was the first hotel I've ever visited around the world that does not allow me to check out earlier. Basically I had to stay for the number of nights as in the reservation.  Paris hotel price dropped significantly and I could book the same room for only half of the original price ($320), so they just lock me into the original rates.\n\nMoreover, the manager was super rude. He basically yelled at me and threatened me to throw out my luggage to the street in five minutes if I didn't follow his order. He said that he did not care about any reviews. I talked to at least four staff. Among them, only one college intern was very sympathetic to my situation. He apologized to me and said he would cancel my booking immediately if he was the manager. However, everyone else was scared of the manager, who looked like a mafia boss (btw, I just realized that the hotel was in a kind of red light district after arrival). They didn't care about others as human beings but care about themselves.  The hotel seems to be run by a ring of criminals in Paris. It was scary that this kind of things happened in Paris Olympics period.\n\nAnyway, I had most positive experiences in Paris and Olympics but not definitely this one. I travelled to so many tough places in the world but this one definitely got me traumatized. Can't believe this kind of hotel exists in the real world. Hopefully, my review will help other guests to avoid this trap. Good luck!\n\n6 months ago\nI made a reservation in January to travel to Paris in August. Due to my family members' health condition, I'd like to adjust the reservation (not cancel the reservation), which is a very small business for a hotel. However, I called many times in the last few weeks and the front desk staff was extremely stubborn. Not only he refused to change, he asked me to speak French only even if he can speak English fluently. I have traveled 30+ countries and made hundreds of hotel reservation.

IT is a minimum!\nThe area is what it is with Street gambling (illegal and you will lose all time); lot of fake branding sellers on the street. Not the cleanest area in Paris but this is independent of the hotel. You will be just next to Anvers tube station; couple of minutes from Gare du Nord national trains and international trains Station; couple of minutes from Sacre Coeur and Moulin Rouge or 30min walk from central Paris which is a great aspect."", 'The room was very, very small, 3 by 4 and it should be renovated as soon as possible. The bathroom was incredibly small, 1.5 by 1.5 - for taller people it will be a nightmare! If you take a look on the booking site, the rooms are wonderful, but the reality is different. This room makes you appreciate what you have in life. The hotel is noisy and the elevators are incredibly small.\nOn the plus side the breakfast was very good and the staff was helpful.', ""I was a little dubious after reading some of the reviews I had read about this hotel. However my girlfriend and I decided to book it as we only really needed a bed for the nights we were staying, as we were going to be exploring the rest of the time. I have to say I am so glad we did!\nIt is ideally looked about 5-10 minutes walk from the Sacré-Cœur, and a 3 minute walk from a Metro station. We arrived exactly at the earliest Check-In time, where we were pleasantly greeted by one of the receptionists. As we were staying for 5 nights she recommended to return in an hour or so after some more of the rooms had been cleaned so we could have one of the rooms which looked onto the courtyard at the back as those are slightly bigger. We happily agreed, took a walk to the Sacré-Cœur (stunning views across the city). Upon returning we were given room 505, which apparently was one of the biggest at the hotel. It was ideal for us, not a view out over the city but we weren't planning on just staying in the hotel to look at the city! The lift in the hotel is apparently the smallest in Paris, which I would agree with as it only holds 3 people (minus luggage), if you have big suitcases it's likely you'll have to go up individually. The entrance area and eating/bar area or quite modern and very well kept. The rest of the hotel is a little dated and the air conditioning units are also a little dated but worked well in the 32 degree weather while we were there. We didn't have the breakfast included in our room but told we could add this on if we wanted (we didn't as we wanted to try the local bakeries). We needed to print out a couple of attraction tickets and the hotel was able to help us with that (30 cents per page). Our room was nice, clean and well kept. The water drained quite slowly in the bathroom so we had to turn off the water every so often when showering so it didn't overflow out of the shower tray but other than that everything was fine. When visiting do beware that the metro does close after 1:40am weekdays and 12:40 on Saturday & Sundays, and with the hotel being about 3 miles from the Eiffel Tower is quite a trek to walk after a long day.  Overall a very pleasant stay and we would both recommend this to anyone who wants to explore the city.""]",18e

The whole hotel is very old. The corridor is narrow. The soundproofing was so poor that conversations in the next room could be heard clearly.

She accommodated me and met a lot of my needs in and out of her control, just to keep me satisfied and comfy as a foreigner (which I valued traveling solo) That’s how you create a loyal customer base. Love Sara and this hotel when I travel to Paris, it’s now my second home away from home.', 'My recent stay at Hotel Le Cardinal in Paris was far from the four-star experience we had anticipated. We requested and confirmed an early check-in, to be paid for an additional 35 euros. However, upon our arrival at 9:30 AM, we were told no room was available. After multiple delays, our room was finally ready at 12:30 PM—hours later than promised.\n\nAlthough the hotel claimed to have upgraded us to a Superior room, the room itself was far from satisfactory. The birthday surprise my boyfriend had arranged was delivered on the wrong day, ruining the moment entirely. While the receptionist initially offered a refund for this mistake, on the actual day of my birthday, my boyfriend had to send numerous emails to get the flowers and cake he had already paid for. After midnight, he had to go down to reception in his pajamas, only to find the bouquet and cake unattended while the receptionist was busy listening to music.\n\nFrustrated, he requested to speak with the Hotel Director the next morning, and on the day of my birthday at 9 AM, he was forced to negotiate a refund for our stay. Initially, the director agreed, but after several emails and discussions, we were only refunded a third of our stay. This wasn’t about the money—it was a matter of principle. There are certain things that money can’t buy or fix, like a ruined celebration and poor service.\n\nTo make matters worse, the room itself was a disaster. Despite being called a superior room, it was dirty, with stained walls and curtains, as you can see in the pictures. The sink was in bad condition, and we could hear every sound from the surrounding rooms, including other guests chatting and water running. Additionally, the fan inside the bathroom, which had no windows, was broken, forcing us to leave the bathroom door open to let the air circulate. Starting from the second day of our stay, both elevators were also out of service, which is unacceptable for a four-star hotel.\n\nWe also asked for assistance in getting to the airport, but they informed us that no NCC (chauffeur) service was available, which was another surprise for a hotel of this rating.\n\nThroughout our stay, all the staff was unprofessional and unhelpful. Many struggled to speak English, and they stopped replying to our complaint emails altogether. Worse still, some of them were laughing while we explained our issues.\n\nOverall, Hotel Le Catedral failed to meet even the most basic expectations of cleanliness, professionalism, and service. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a pleasant stay in Paris.']",9e

The area alone sets a great tone for a stay. Upon entering the hotel, the lobby impresses with its Belle Époque-style decor, immediately immersing guests in a refined atmosphere.\n\nHowever, the charm begins to wane upon entering the rooms. As is often the case in Paris, the rooms are exceptionally small, creating an uncomfortable sense of closeness. While the room was tastefully decorated, the decor felt somewhat dated, with signs of wear such as a malfunctioning sink and an unpleasantly warm temperature during the night. Overall, despite its aesthetic appeal, the room lacked the comfort one would expect, especially for a four-star hotel.\n\nThe breakfast experience was equally disappointing, featuring low-quality industrial products without any distinctive style or charm. At a price of €200 per night, the overall value feels exorbitant. This hotel would be more appropriately priced at around €150, where it could be considered decent but still far from exceptional. Sadly, it seems like yet another Parisian hotel stuck in the 1990s, delivering a lackluster experience under the guise of four-star prestige.', 'My husband and I had a lovely stay at the hotel Josephine. It is in a really excellent location: close to the metro stations, shops and lots of restaurants. The staff at the hotel were friendly and caring. The room was clean and tidy and nicely decorated with all the facilities you would need. The only downside being the air con, which due to being an eco friendly hotel, wasn’t able to go to less than 19 degrees which was probably needed when it was super hot outside in August.', 'If you want to be close to Montmarte you want to stay at Hotel Josephine.

A €100 deposit was required at check-in, which was placed on hold on my credit card and refunded after 15 days, as per the hotel’s policy. The location is ideal, situated just one street below the iconic Sacré-Cœur Basilica, offering convenient access to local attractions.

However, while checking out, we have to remind them for the deposit.\nThe location is good, but at night, it's not safe."", ""Very good for what we paid, a little dated but spotlessly clean and pleasant staff, my 100 euro security deposit was returned to my account the same day I checked out. I'd definitely stay here again"", 'Rude and incompetent staff being the biggest adversity in staying here. Mario greeted us with poor attitude consistently throughout our trip. The hotel has an absurd policy in which you must return the key to the reception desk everytime you wish to leave (Despite demanding a €100 deposit upon arrival). On one instance, my partner went to Mcdonald’s to buy food, whilst I stayed in the room. She locked me in and provided Mario with the key at reception. Mario then promptly lost our key in the 5 minutes he was left with it, and proceeded to blame my partner for losing it. When this was proven false, he went on to lie, stating he passed the key over to myself. As I was locked in the room at this point, I can confirm this was not the case. Reception staff then kindly freed me from the locked room. I was then forced to demand a thorough search for the key, as Mario didn’t seem particularly bothered, presumably planning what he would do with my €100 deposit. Mario had placed it in the wrong location. He went onto state ‘someone must have put it on the wrong peg’. By this point I was exhausted with listening to Mario and returned to my room with no compensation for my trouble.\n\nThey also lock the main door, despite offering a 24/7 reception.There is no doorbell, you must wait for reception to finish what they’re doing to allow entry.\n\nThe rooms are dated, we had no toiletries provided on arrival aside from two measly bars of soap. There is a receptacle in the shower for gel, however this was empty and falling off the wall. Through fear of breaking it further and losing our €100 deposit, we used the bars of soap. The website states toiletries are available on request, and we were provided with a quarter bottle of shampoo when we requested the basic amenities for the room. Following this slap to the face, we opted to purchase any further toiletries as the dribble of shampoo provided appeared to have come from lost property.\n\nAn iron and ironing board were provided on request. When using this, the ironing board was so thin it actually burnt the pattern of the grid below the sheet onto my shirt. Other provided amenities included a kettle with a cord too short to reach the desk, and a telephone, in which we were called on in the early hours of the morning to return the iron back to reception.\n\nWith the room being a tiny box, there was minimal space for anything. A rail is provided, with 4 hangers to share between us on our 5 night stay. A small television, which if you squint you may be able to enjoy one of the few provided channels.\n\nEnergy saving is a big theme in Hotel Bellevue, with lighting that switches off after a few moments. This is the case on the stairs, in which no natural light comes in, leaving a pitch black narrow staircase to navigate if you dare to adhere to the energy saving advice the hotel passes to you on your welcome card.\n\nWe did make use of the fan, which was invaluable in the summer heat. However, despite the heat in the room we dared not to open the window. As you will have seen whilst scrolling the reviews for this hotel, there appears to be a trend of burglaries that have occurred here. I’ve noted the replies from the owner to these reviews. These responses at best, pass responsibility to the individuals who were robbed in their establishment and at worst, downright accuse their clients of telling lies. I can only presume Mario has been taking some time out from losing keys to respond to the honest feedback from his rightfully outraged guests.\n\nI have made allusion to the €100 deposit multiple times in this review. Predictably, this was not returned to us on time. We had to email the hotel (as they would not answer the phone) to demand the deposit be returned.\n\nThis is a one star experience advertised as three and a half.

It’s 2* but nothing is a deficit it’s just not over the top.

However, the location is great, and the reception is open 24/7."", 'I am deeply disappointed with my stay at Le Regent Montmartre. Not only were the conditions unacceptable, but the response to my formal complaint revealed a complete lack of professionalism from the management.\nFirst, the absence of soap for washing hands after using the toilet in the shared bathrooms is simply outrageous, especially in a post-pandemic context where hygiene is crucial. There was no clear mention that soap had to be purchased at the reception. This is a basic hygiene requirement that every establishment should provide, particularly in shared spaces.\nSecondly, the elevator was out of service for the entire duration of my stay, reportedly because someone had vomited in it or left food—who knows. This not only made the elevator unusable, but it forced me to carry heavy luggage up the stairs without any assistance. No attempt was made to resolve this issue promptly, which is a clear violation of basic hygiene and accessibility standards.\nThe check-in process was a nightmare, with a 30-minute wait and four return trips to the reception before I could finally get into my room. No key card was provided, meaning I had to go to the reception every single time I needed access to my room—an incredibly frustrating and avoidable issue.\nAs for the room, there was a strong odor of cheese that made the experience unbearable. While it may not have been strictly a cleanliness issue, it was still a terrible experience overall, and the staff’s justification that it was ""normal"" for a dormitory was both condescending and unacceptable.\nFinally, the staff’s behavior was disrespectful and condescending, which only worsened the situation. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, my legitimate frustration was downplayed, and I was treated as if I should expect such poor conditions.\nI strongly advise against this establishment for anyone seeking even a minimum level of comfort and customer service. Unfortunately, no refund was offered despite these major inconveniences, and the management seems entirely disinterested in improving the guest experience.', 'I stayed here for 4 nights, and honestly, it was a pretty bad experience. On the first night, there was no heater, and it was really cold in the room. All they gave us was an extra blanket and a fan that only blew cold air, which didn’t help at all. For the other nights, they did bring a heater, but it was barely enough — the room still felt freezing.\n\nAlso, the listing mentioned a bathtub, but there wasn’t one, which felt pretty misleading. To top it off, the neighborhood was a bit sketchy, so I didn’t feel very comfortable coming back late at night. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this place.

Usually in hostels there is a lot of activity and socializing, but there was very little here. It depends on your preference if you enjoy that or not. It was in a great place, right next to the Sacré-Cœur. I walked a few times just to look at the whole of Paris. It is a short train ride to the center of the city and most of the other typical Paris sights. The rooms were very modest though, clean but a bit run down. The bathrooms especially need a bit of renovation. The ""kitchen"" was small and while meals could be prepared it was only a small corner in the lobby.

We had to leave and wait in the lobby for three hours until it was light enough to leave because we couldn't bear being in the room anymore. The concierge never asked us if there was a problem or why we were not in our room. Neither did he bother to come and ask what was wrong, although it was pretty clear that we were leaving their hotel for another in Montmartre.\nClearly, the staff simply do not care about severe health and safety breaches, their customers, or the hotel's cleanliness (the rooms were littered with mouse droppings and had previous guests' items).

The rooms were clean and tidy and the bedding was fresh and clean with fresh towels available.\n\nRoom 2, a twin with two singles had more space and also an air conditioning unit so the room was clean, tidy, fresh and could be kept cool.\n\nThere were safes in both rooms but we did not use them. Both rooms were rear facing so looking in to other rooms.\n\nIn my opinion the hotel was clean, tidy and the staff were helpful.

Room was decent, bathroom big enough and nice and clean, and you have a Monoprix a few doors away to get whatever snacks might be needed for your stay. Not sure if we would stay there again though unless prices were crazy everywhere else.', 'I had the misfortune of staying at what can only be described as the worst hotel I’ve ever encountered. I’ve traveled extensively for work and stayed in many, many hotels, yet I’ve never experienced anything like this.\n\nUpon check-in, I politely inquired if it would be possible to check in early. Rather than addressing my request, the receptionist **literally** instructed me to ""take a seat"" while she continued a personal conversation. As I patiently waited, it became painfully clear that I had been deliberately dismissed and ignored simply because I asked to check in early. When I finally questioned whether anyone would be addressing my query, she blatantly ignored me. When pressed for an explanation as to why I was told to wait, she attempted to dismiss me with a robotic, insincere response of “thanks,” effectively ending the conversation without resolving anything.\n\nAn hour later, as if the earlier incident wasn’t enough, I was informed that I had to retrieve my own suitcase from the luggage room. No assistance was offered, which in itself was unacceptable. However, what followed was even more shocking and downright unsettling: while making my way to my room, another staff member approached me, questioning why I had my own suitcase and insinuating that I was on the wrong floor. I am absolutely certain she deliberately called the elevator down to her floor just to stop and question me for her own amusement. It was clear this was part of a twisted game to patronize and humiliate guests for fun.\n\nTo make matters worse, I discovered that the air conditioning in the room can be remotely controlled by the staff. One review mentioned this, and we most definitely experienced it ourselves. I had set the room to a comfortable 24 degrees, only to find that it had been reset to the maximum setting without my input. It’s yet another example of the staff exerting unnecessary control over guests, further adding to the discomfort of the stay.\n\nWhat adds to the frustration is the complete ineffectiveness of the assistant manager, Bertrand Aubrey. Despite his seemingly apologetic responses to negative reviews, the staff’s atrocious attitude remains unchanged. This leaves only two possibilities: either every employee, regardless of rank, shares the same disdain for guests, or Bertrand is simply not respected in his role, rendering his apologies meaningless and his authority nonexistent.\n\nIt’s worth noting that my experience isn’t unique—many other reviews highlight the hotel’s consistently poor customer service. I strongly urge future guests not to be blinded by the occasional good review. If you don’t speak or look French, good luck getting any sort of respectful treatment here. The staff seem to cater to a certain demographic while showing blatant disregard for others.\n\nHowever, not all the staff were bad. I must mention the black gentleman working the night shift, who was genuinely kind and professional. He was the one bright spot in an otherwise disastrous stay, and he clearly belongs in the field of service. His demeanor and attitude were everything you’d expect in hospitality, and it’s a shame the rest of the team doesn’t follow his example.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly advise anyone considering a stay here to **AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS**. While there are a few good employees, the overall experience is marred by unprofessional and disrespectful behavior that has no place in the hospitality industry. Save yourself the frustration and choose another hotel.', 'The rooms are clean and tidy. The staff behaves normally.

They replied to us very quickly by mail and were helpful to us. The breakfast was meager. There are limitations to what you are allowed to take. The quality of the coffee is terrible. I was leaving early the next day and asked if it was possible to get a breakfast package. It turned out this is not a service they provide here. If you book with breakfast keep in mind it's strictly between 7 and 10.\n\nThe room:\nThe room is okay for a short stay. The beds were decent. There are lockers in the room that you can use.  You need your own padlock. If you don't have one there are some in the vending machine at -1. Eating in the room is not allowed. The room temperature is very manageable. The temperature of the shower and tap however are not. The water is quite hot, so I hope you love hot showers. When you shower the whole bathroom floor will be wet. It would be nice if they add a shower squeegee to dry the floor and a shelf to put your clothes to keep them dry and clean when you shower/change. Lastly the vent was a bit moldy.\n\nThe location:\nThe location was perfect for us. It's very close to Gare du Nord. It's only a 15 to 20 min walk. It's also quite close to other metro stations. It's not difficult to get to the city center if that's where you want to go.\n\n(Extra tip for the metro: Get a day pass online. You need a french phone number to register but you can use an application to get a temporary phone number to bypass this. The day pass tickets will be 8 euros there for zone 1 and 2. You can choose the zones based on your preferences while at the machine you are forced to get a ticket for zone 1 till 3 and will cost about 14 euros. The individual metro tickets cost 2,15 per ticket I think so you can also just buy two single tickets just to get to the center and back if you don't mind walking around a bit. )"", ""In general, it was okay.

On the first day, karaoke and music were played in the lobby until 0:15, which seems to be a regular occurrence here, because the next day there was also a music event in the lobby until late at night – so earplugs should definitely be brought along. However, the worst part was that the ventilation in the room couldn’t be turned off, resulting in constant noise, and the blower was aimed directly at our heads all night! In the morning, we woke up with puffy eyes and stuffy noses. The reception couldn’t help with this issue. In general, it can be said that the service was at least basic, with the advantage of a 24-hour reception, and they did refill the soap after our complaint.\n\nUnfortunately, the breakfast was also a disappointment. The fruit was mostly overripe, and each guest was limited to two small bread rolls. Overall, it was a big disappointment.', 'Very nice place with exceptionally kind staff.

The combination of poor service and inadequate facilities made our stay highly disappointing. I hope you take this feedback seriously to improve the experience for future guests.', 'For the price, this room is totally worth the price. The staff at the front desk were extremely kind and helpful. The metro station is a mere 10 mins walk which makes it really easy. Lots of places to eat near by, the rooms are a little tiny, but I guess you get what you pay for!', 'Very good stay, good price and close to the bus and metro stations. They have vending machine and a coffee machine downstairs, which was convenient. The neighborhood was nice. The room was small but clean. Overall, i enjoyed my stay.', 'The rooms are okay but super small, restrooms are small. They have no face towel! Bath towel are thin and barely drys your body!! There is no fan in the restroom so if you need to go poop make sure you bring a can of air freshener! The so call breakfast is nothing to jump for they have tons of bread and cold cut ham, greasy bacon! The location where the hotel is located doesn’t appear to be safe graffiti everywhere!!', 'I’ve stayed here twice now.\nOn both occasions the room has been fine, most of the staff are friendly, but not overly so, although the lady on reception when I arrived was charming and always welcoming. I found it to be a good location for getting to just about anywhere I wanted to go - whether into the city centre or out.\nThere are plenty of places to eat and buy food just down the hill toward Saint-Fargeau. In fact the 20th is probably my favourite district of the city.']",19e

Aparthotel Adagio Paris 19eme Cité de la Musique,"28 Bd d'Indochine, 75019 Paris, France",48.8854894,2.3969921,818,3.7,"['Amazing customer service, great communication and very accommodating! They gave us the highest floor with a lovely view at night + they decorated our room because I told them that we were celebrating our anniversary - thank you so much! Will come back when visiting Paris again :)', 'I recently stayed at the Adagio and while the room condition, cleanliness, and location were commendable, the experience was completely marred by the unacceptable attitude of the receptionist and night shift manager.\n\nUpon arrival, we were not informed of the hotel’s room cleaning service policy, which led to a misunderstanding later on. When we requested a new towel, as the old one was no longer usable, the night shift manager displayed an incredibly rude and arrogant attitude. Instead of addressing our request, the manager kept insisting, “Someone was supposed to inform you,” and, “Our receptionist should have told you during check-in,” as if pushing all the responsibility onto us.\n\nWe understand that each hotel has its own policies, but what angered us was the unprofessional and hostile manner in which we were treated. The manager chose to lecture us in an extremely condescending tone, saying things like, “We don’t work the same way as in your country,” and, “You’re supposed to understand our policies at ADAGIO.”\n\nTo make matters worse, the conversation escalated when the manager accused us of sneaking extra people into the hotel room, implying that our request for an extra towel was somehow an attempt to take advantage of the hotel. This accusation was baseless, as we had clearly booked a twin room for two adults and had all the necessary booking confirmations to prove it. The manager’s unprofessional conduct and insinuations were completely out of line and left us feeling deeply insulted.\n\nIt’s disappointing that such a well-located hotel with good amenities is tarnished by the rude and unprofessional behavior of its staff. It’s a real shame that the reputation of this hotel is being ruined by the very people who are supposed to uphold its standards. What a waste!', 'A great location for the arena and the philharmonic, lots of bars and restaurants close. The rooms are basic but comfortable. My room as a double was 2 singles pushed together but as I travel on my own it was fine.', 'I honestly enjoyed my stay here. Loved my room,clean and spacious. Got the top floor room on level 9. The location had easy access to public transportation so I could easily take the metro (porte de pantin) to the city centre and touristy places. I enjoyed the breakfasts though not much variety. Overall I would recommend it based on my experience.', 'From the moment I walked in I felt extreme discrimination. I very kindly spoke to the receptionist and asked to make a reservation. I asked how much it will cost for the days I needed. I was told a price that was 3x more than the amount that was advertised online on countless websites. The customer service was very bad. I do not recommend this place to anyone.']",19e
